4-H Guide for NASA GLOBE Observer Clouds,National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA),CCS Authority,"The 4-H guide is designed to encourage youth to become citizen scientists by providing opportunities for cloud observation, data collection, and study. The program is geared toward achieving seven objectives for student participants: (1) learn what clouds are and how they form; (2) learn about the different types of clouds; (3) identify the study site, take observations of the sky, and upload data to the GLOBE database; (4) explain why cloud observations are important for understanding our changing Earth system; (5) develop an understanding of the challenge of visually estimating the percentage of cloud cover, gain experience estimating cloud cover, evaluate the accuracy of estimates, and use fractions and percentages; (6) become engaged in the process of science; and (7) become part of a worldwide community of learners and scientists.","Citizen science is a unique way to actively involve youth in data collection for science research while also teaching the importance of data collection. By participating in a citizen science project, youth can gain exposure to and learn more about a particular project topic. The 4-H Clouds guide is created to introduce youth to citizen science, conduct activities that provide deeper learning about the subject of clouds, and learn more about career opportunities related to the study of clouds and weather.",The project launched in November 2018.,The program will be available across the U.S.,The project targets U.S. 4-H youth.,N/A,"Using a mobile device, youth take images of the sky and collect other data as directed by the Clouds module in the GLOBE Observer mobile app for submission to the GLOBE Data and Information System, hosted at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).","There is no dedicated budget or funds for this effort. Support for 4-H science education programs was provided by 4-H National Headquarters, NIFA, and USDA. Employees were used to contribute content to the guide, review drafts of the guide, and present at a poster session at a national conference of 4-H professionals. In FY17 and FY18, 0.1 full-time equivalents supported the project. No NIFA resources or funds were used for this project in FY17 or FY18. However, a small team of 4-H educators, supported by NASA GLOBE, attended a meeting at NASA Goddard to learn about GLOBE, use the Clouds module in the GLOBE Observer app, and make recommendations for the use of the app and other GLOBE resources in 4-H nationwide. The lead developer of the guide is a 4-H state specialist at Rutgers.","Federal partners included the Global Learning and Observations to benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program, which is sponsored by NASA and supported by NSF, NOAA, and the U.S. Department of State. Non-Federal partners included Rutgers University 4-H.","The 4-H guide aligns with NIFA’s mission: to “invest in and advance agricultural research, education, and extension to solve societal challenges.” This project helps youth to learn about a subject area (clouds and weather) that is important to agriculture. It involves youth in science data collection and research and demonstrates how citizen science can contribute to solving societal problems.","NASA scientists use the cloud observations submitted by citizen scientists, in conjunction with data gathered from satellites, to better understand the importance of clouds to our changing earth environment. Rutgers University hosted the guide on their 4-H web site and collect data from participants to gain information on the usage and application of the guide.",Data will be collected by 4-H youth through the Clouds module in the GLOBE Observer app. This data will be available to the public through the GLOBE visualization system on the GLOBE web site: https://vis.globe.gov/clouds.
"Boise Multi-Party Monitoring, Boise, ID",USDA Forest Service,CCS Authority,"The mission of the citizen-led Boise Forest Coalition (BFC) is to provide the Boise National Forest with management recommendations that: 1) Are developed through consensus decisions involving all members of the Coalition; 2) Address natural resource, economic, recreational, and societal needs; 3) Are compatible with Forest Plan direction including implementation of the Forest's Wildlife and Aquatic Conservation Strategies; 4) Are economically realistic; and 5) Promote future collaboration during implementation and monitoring. The Emmett Ranger District is positioned to start implementing a multi-party monitoring strategy involving data collection that could include photo points, surface fuel and overstory forest conditions, wildlife surveys, economic analysis, and recreational use.","The agency has recently entered into a Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) agreement with the state of Idaho for one of the sale areas on the Emmett Ranger District. Given the state’s different management approach and objectives, there has been uncertainty and apprehension from some members of the public with the GNA process, particularly for a project that was developed collaboratively with multiple resource objectives. Implementing a multi-party monitoring strategy would help to build trust between our stakeholders, the state of Idaho, and the USDA Forest Service. It would also provide an opportunity for international students and students from local universities to become engaged in collaboration and citizen science.

Científicos en Familia: A Program to Engage Diverse Communities in Citizen Science and Stewardship,USDA Forest Service,CCS Authority,"Corazón Latino and NorthBay have created a pilot program to engage, train, and empower diverse families, primarily Latino, from the Washington D.C./Virginia/Maryland region to become citizen scientists, applying their acquired knowledge to support the U.S. Forest Service’s (USFS) mission, information needs, and restoration efforts. Focus on forest health/human health connections and the relationship between healthy forests and clean water will provide avenues for participating families to become Citizen Science Corps members who can activate to collect meaningful data to meet USFS information needs. The bilingual strategic communications and stakeholder engagement outreach are empowering regional and national audiences using digital tools, social media, traditional media (TV, print, radio) and community outreach (events, workshops, presentations). USFS will generate a citizen science community engagement model for diverse communities that can be adapted, replicated, and scaled throughout the nation. Final deliverables and reporting will include an English/Spanish-language toolkit and project implementation manual.","Empowering the public to identify natural resource issues, and to be involved in science-based solutions, is a pathway to developing advocates for sustainable public land management. Empowering diverse communities to make informed decisions about conservation issues will provide the USFS and other land management agencies with avenues to invite, include, and involve diverse audiences in public engagement activities around land management.","The project started on April 29, 2018, and is ongoing.","The project is located in Washington, D.C. and the George Washington Jefferson National Forest  (GWJNF).","The project targeted semi-rural and urban Hispanic and African American youth and their families, including 4th graders and “Every Kid in Park” program participants.

Citizen Science for Rangeland Health: Engaging Ranchers in Science,USDA Forest Service,CCS Authority,"The Citizen Science for Rangeland Health project intends to monitor resource issues of mutual concern to grazing permittees and the USFS on grazing allotments in the San Juan National Forest. Rangeland managers need data to manage resources sustainably. The USFS and rancher volunteers will work to 1) agree on a resource issue of mutual concern that can be addressed through data collection (spring 2018); 2) decide on a monitoring protocol and locations for answering questions (spring 2018); 3) host training on data collection methods (early summer 2018 and 2019); 4) collect data with data collection coordinators form Colorado State University (CSU), USFS personnel, and ranchers (summers 2018 and 2019); 5) conduct analyses on data in fall of 2018 (preliminary) and 2019; and 6) host several joint-interpretation sessions (fall/winter 2018/2019) with broader group of ranchers and community members.","Engaging ranchers in citizen science will generate information on important management issues in the area, empower ranchers to be stewards of the resources they manage and to take a more active role in observing land trends. The project adds value by generating data to inform decisions and increasing the efficiency and mutual respect among ranchers and agency staff. At times, USFS and ranchers disagree on assessing rangeland conditions. By agreeing on methods, locations, and jointly collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data, this project engages ranchers and USFS agency staff in building and using a data set for evidence-based decisions. It also provides a framework for enhancing collaboration among ranchers and USFS staff and empowers all parties to engage with data and decisions on the Forest.",The project started in FY18 and is ongoing.,"The project is located in the San Juan National Forest in Dolores, CO.","The project targeted local and regional ranchers, The Rangeland Stewardship Committee, other rural residents and recreationalists, and the Local Future Farmers of America Chapter","No volunteer hours have been recorded yet, so no consent was needed.",N/A,"Funding for CCS projects comes from congressionally appropriated dollars to USDA.

Acquiring this information can be time consuming depending on methodology. Grazing permittees are partners that can assist in collecting and mapping this information on a yearly basis. By collaboratively educating partners to collect this information, it will provide USFS with a more robust data set for making decisions. In addition, the landscape in question currently lacks ecological site descriptions, which are often used to identify desired conditions and objectives during the planning process. An assessment of existing relict sites across the landscape will provide USFS with a better understanding of site potential. Lastly, USFS currently collects vegetation and ground cover data at various permanent transect locations to determine composition and change over time. This is one of the pieces of information used to determine the effects of grazing.","The public will have the opportunity to engage in data interpretation via open meetings.

Culturally Responsive Citizen Science Development with Forest Inventory Analysis in Interior Alaska,USDA Forest Service,CCS Authority,"The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program is a nationwide inventory of forested lands which began in Interior Alaska in 2016. A culturally appropriate method of conducting citizen science in line with local priorities has not been conducted at a broad scale across rural Alaska or Alaska Native communities. FIA crews are based in rural and/or Alaska Native communities for months at a time. The short, intensive period during which employees live in communities limits time to build critical relationships, and collected data may be disconnected from community needs and priorities. A culturally-responsive citizen science approach coupled with typical data collection methods may reduce challenges FIA faces in communities, build partnerships, and increase youth opportunities. This program initiates co-creation of local forest health citizen science projects integrating local knowledge with FIA data. FIA will partner with the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) citizen science program through University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) to facilitate projects and maintain long-term relationships.","FIA collects data for use by scientists and managers across the country to undertake locally or regionally relevant research or management decisions. Having local understanding would assist researchers and managers in contextualizing projects or outcomes and provide a more complete perspective. This is especially important in Interior Alaska where change is occurring rapidly and baseline data are often lacking. Enabling communities to participate in determining issues worthy of further citizen-directed research or action as well as co-create and undertake projects is an efficient and cost effective way for USFS and FIA to further our mission and collect wider and more inclusive data/knowledge, while increasing community engagement and ownership of the data and process. Partnering with a thoroughly vetted citizen science and education organization such as GLOBE increases the efficacy of conducting a citizen science project at such a large scale. GLOBE offers a range of environmental monitoring protocols (landcover, soils, phenology, hydrology, wildfire, etc.) that have been peer-reviewed, externally evaluated, and used by youth and communities in over 110 countries since 1995.","The project started in FY18, and is ongoing.","The project is located in Anchorage, Alaska.","The project targeted local community members including elders, adults, and youth of all ages.

They will apply the data they collect to a stewardship action project of their own design. 3) Build knowledge about natural resources, conservation, and stewardship of our Nation’s forests and grasslands by developing and implementing effective, standards-based, contemporary conservation education programs that reach all America’s youth: youth will engage in a culturally responsive learning model for citizen science developed by the UAF GLOBE program.","FIA is mandated to provide information to assess America’s forests on a continuous basis. In 2016, Interior FIA was the last FIA program to be implemented nationally. This effort has the unique opportunity to inform data collection efforts by incorporating locally-identified concerns and co-creating citizen science investigations to address forest health concerns while improving community relationships. This shared customer/public role in project design meets the goal of delivering benefits to the public and excelling as a high-performing agency through exemplary public service. Today, boreal regions are subject to rapid change and current and historical data are critical. Further, a high proportion of communities in the boreal region are rural and indigenous. Citizen science, as an approach to scientific research and engagement, struggles with attracting cultural groups underrepresented in STEM careers. This is often attributed to a mismatch between scientific goals and community concerns. Establishing and evaluating a process for flexible culturally-responsive citizen science with FIA will further engage Alaska Native stakeholders in Forest Service science and scientific research. The strategic partnership with GLOBE Alaska extends data collected by community teams to a global audience, providing data on boreal forest variables for current and future research.","Data collected from community projects will be housed within the GLOBE database which currently houses over 130 million measurements accessible to land managers, scientists, students, and the public at www.globe.gov. FIA data will be available via FIA DataBase, and can be accessed at https://apps.fs.usda.gov/fia/datamart/. FIA data are also available via a landowner report for landowners who have an FIA plot on their land and who request it. FIA data is publically available, however the program is mandated to keep plot location and owner information confidential to comply with Federal privacy legislation and to preserve the integrity of the plot/sample."
Engaging Angler Scientists to Help Prioritize and Monitor the Effectiveness of Stream Reconnection Projects,USDA Forest Service,CCS Authority,"This project formalizes a collaboration between Trout Unlimited (TU) and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) to empower citizen scientists, including TU anglers, college students, and other interested members of the community to 1) conduct road-stream crossing surveys to understand Aquatic Organism Passage (AOP), and 2) conduct brook trout spawning surveys to provide baseline biological data associated with barriers and to monitor the effectiveness of AOP projects and other stream treatments. USFS and TU staff have invested significant resources to assess road-stream crossings for AOP issues.","This project meets objectives in the 2017 Rise to the Future: National Fish & Aquatic Strategy including Goal 2: Connect People to the Outdoors Through Fishing, Boating, and Other Aquatic Activities. While some national forests have been comprehensively surveyed, many still have significant gaps in the understanding of their aquatic connectivity. Empowering citizen scientists to assist with these surveys will expand USFS capacity to understand AOP across entire forests and to better prioritize stream reconnection projects that benefit brook trout and other aquatic organisms. This project leverages TU’s strong grassroots base and regional project staff to develop pilot projects in eastern National Forest lands. By developing resources and demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach, this project will facilitate and promote expansion of AOP assessment and monitoring to other national forests throughout the eastern U.S. Through these monitoring efforts, volunteers will gain a connection to these watersheds and the efforts to improve them, and may be further engaged in restoration projects.","The project started in FY18, and is ongoing.","The project is located in Pisgah-Nantahala, George Washington-Jefferson, Allegheny, and Huron-Manistee National Forests.","The project targeted outdoor recreationists, college students, high school students, rural community members.","No volunteer hours have been recorded yet, so no consent was needed.",N/A,"Funding for CCS projects comes from congressionally appropriated dollars to USDA.

The project will enhance management decisions regarding brook trout population reconnection on National Forest lands. By increasing the capacity of the USFS to collect useful AOP data, stakeholders can better prioritize specific culverts for restoration, replacement, or further evaluation. In this way, the USFS can focus efforts in identified priority areas, resulting in a more efficient use of limited funding, and a watershed-scale management strategy for the reconnection of aquatic habitat and brook trout populations. Spawning surveys have been shown to be an effective method to monitor population trends in salmonids over time and are more cost effective than other techniques, allowing more populations to be monitored over longer periods of time.","By mapping the distribution of redds (the spawning ground or nest of fish) over time, USFS can identify priority areas for stream treatment projects and document population response to our investments.","Barrier data entered on the mobile application form developed by Southeastern Aquatic Resources Partnership (SARP) is automatically uploaded to their Regional Barrier Inventory. Citizen science-collected data is mapped and used by USFS, TU, state agencies and others in the Southeast to aid in project selection and prioritization.

"Engaging Citizen Scientists in Field Research on American Pika, an Indicator Species for Alpine Ecosystem Integrity",USDA Forest Service,CCS Authority,"The American pika, Ochotona princeps, is a small, charismatic mammal in western North America that is sensitive to climate-driven variation in temperature, snowpack, and vegetation composition. Extirpation of pika populations and range retraction linked to climate change has been documented in the Great Basin, Southern Utah, and California. The species may be more resilient to climate change in the extensive, high-elevation habitat found in the Southern Rocky Mountains (SRM). However, recent research predicts that pikas may be extirpated from Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) during this century under some climate change scenarios. There is a pressing need to assess the species’ vulnerability to climate change across the SRM, particularly in National Forests, where the majority of pika habitat in the region is found. The White River National Forest (WRNF) has identified pika as a focal species and aims to determine the status of pika populations as an indicator of alpine ecosystem integrity. The Front Range Pika Project (FRPP) seeks funding to engage citizen scientists in field surveys, to collect data the WRNF needs to determine pika distribution and improve understanding of environmental variables that limit pika distribution using a vetted, peer-reviewed protocol. These data, along with long-term monitoring of occupancy trends, are essential to predicting and tracking the species’ response to climate change on the WRNF. In addition, the project will establish capacity for long-term, citizen science monitoring of pika in the WRNF, and advance the Southern Rockies Pika Partnership’s (SRPP) research goals.","This project will be implemented by the FRPP (co-directed by Rocky Mountain Wild and Denver Zoo), in coordination with the SRPP, a partnership collaborating to expand citizen science research on pika in the region. The FRPP has trained over 200 volunteers to collect high quality data since 2010 and has 80 active volunteers. Through expansion of pika citizen science research to the WRNF, the FRPP will enable the WRNF to efficiently determine current pika distribution, and lay the groundwork for long-term monitoring to discern changes in alpine ecosystems and pika distribution occurring as a result of climate change. A trained volunteer cohort will survey multiple areas across the forest using an established, scientifically rigorous protocol.","The project started on August 22, 2018, and is ongoing.","The project is located in White River National Forest in Glenwood Springs, CO.","The project targeted outdoor recreationists, rural communities surrounding the WRNF, urban communities in the region with a large potential volunteer base, youth, and members of local and regional nonprofit conservation and stewardship organizations.

The WRNF plans to determine the status of American pika populations as an indicator of alpine ecosystem integrity per the 2016 WRNF Monitoring Plan. Pika occupancy surveys are needed to determine current pika distribution and whether distribution patterns on the WRNF are most strongly limited by climate stress, topographic constraints, habitat extent, habitat connectivity, biological interactions, or some combination of these factors.","This study will also establish capacity for long-term monitoring to enable the WRNF to predict and track impacts of climate change on pika and inform potential management actions to improve pika resiliency to climate change. In summary, a WRNF partnership with Rocky Mountain Wild and Denver Zoo through the FRPP will provide vital data to discern the status of pika on the WRNF, provide the opportunity for long-term pika monitoring to increase the WRNF’s understanding of climate change effects on this focal species and inform management options.","Data will be open-access on CitSci.org, whose audience includes researchers, managers, educational institutions, and the public. USFS will share project updates and results with volunteers and local communities through presentations at events (including at least two end-of-season volunteer events), newsletters, web pages, social media of partner and participating organizations, and local news outlets. USFS will share results with the Forest Service through a written report to WRNF Reporting in the appropriate Forest Service databases (e.g., Volunteer Services Reporting); NatureWatch, Interpretation, and Conservation Education database; and the Natural Resource Manager among others. USFS will share results with the scientific community through presentations at conferences (e.g., North American Pika Consortium Conference, CitSci 2019); reporting results to the Southern Rockies Pika Partnership; and considering publishing in a scientific journal if results merit publication."
Location of Plants Traditionally Used by American Indian Tribes to Improve Management of Federal Lands on the Four Forest Restoration Initiative,USDA Forest Service,CCS Authority,"In a consultation between the USFS and numerous Arizona and New Mexico tribes, tribes requested that the USFS collect information on traditionally-used plants for consideration in the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI) analysis to develop management protocols that preserve identified plants. This proposal responds to this information need by providing data collected by citizen scientists on the location of hard-to-locate, non-abundant, traditionally-used plants/herbs to 1) 4FRI managers to develop management protocols to ensure long-term sustainability and availability of these resources for tribes; 2) tribal members to be featured in educational materials and utilized as a repository of ecological knowledge for important plant species; and 3) researchers to devise scientifically-based management and restoration protocols for these culturally important plant species. The 4FRI is the largest Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Project in the country influencing the management of 2.4 million acres in central Arizona on the Apache-Sitgreaves, Coconino, Kaibab, and Tonto National Forests. These data, therefore, have the potential to affect management at a broad geographic scale.","In government-to-government consultation with local tribes regarding 4FRI, tribal authorities requested that the management of traditionally-used plant species be considered during 4FRI planning to prevent population decline or extirpation during project execution. Spatial data on plant populations will allow the USFS to meet this request, as well as to identify traditional collection areas for which site-specific management protocols will be developed. Locating traditionally-used plants is challenging due to the size of the 4FRI lands and the need for experienced botanists to correctly identify plant species. By harnessing the natural history expertise of local tribes to identify populations of species of interest, USFS can meet the tribes’ request with increased efficiency for USDA.",The project started in FY18 and is ongoing.,"The project is located in Williams, AZ and Apache-Sitgreaves, Coconino, Kaibab, and Tonto National Forests.","The project targeted tribal youth, at-risk youth, underserved communities, tribal communities, and natural resource partners.","No volunteer hours have been recorded yet, so no consent was needed.",N/A,"Funding for CCS projects comes from congressionally appropriated dollars to USDA.

Additionally, this project will strengthen the partnership between the USFS, Northern Arizona University (NAU), and federally recognized tribes by promoting an exchange of expertise on natural resource management and encouraging future collaborations to scientifically evaluate management and conservation of these species. By protecting culturally, economically, and ecologically important species and sharing distribution information with local tribes, this project will ensure that social, economic, and environmental benefits flow from forest and grassland resources (outcome 2), thus strengthening the engagement of tribal communities with public land management and promoting the connection of these communities with their natural and cultural heritage. Finally, conservation of traditionally-used plant species promotes forest and grassland ecosystems that are resilient and adaptive in a changing environment (outcome 3), as such species contribute to ecosystem health and function.",This project will add value to resource management by providing spatial data on the location of traditionally used plants on 4FRI lands to USFS land managers. Spatial data on plant populations will allow the USFS to identify traditional collection areas for which site-specific management protocols will be developed.,"The data will be open-access for USFS employees, selected researchers, and tribal members through the iNaturalist platform. Obscured location information will be provided to the general public, in order to prevent targeted harvest of these potentially valuable species.

Monitoring the Status of the Columbia River Gorge Pika Population After the Eagle Creek Fire,USDA Forest Service,CCS Authority,"Last fall, the Eagle Creek Fire (ECF) burned nearly the entire low-elevation distribution of pikas, small mammals which are important bellwethers to environmental changes, on the Oregon side of the Columbia River Gorge (CRG), prompting widespread public interest in the fate of CRG pikas. Following this event, this project addresses the following goals: 1) leverage an extensive pre-fire distribution dataset to document the extent of changes in CRG pika distribution, following the ECF; 2) engage citizen scientists in conducting pika surveys and collecting additional habitat data; and 3) analyze predictors of pika density and monitor recolonization of disturbed habitat.","American pikas create an ideal platform for citizen science. In addition to being charismatic, easily identifiable, and residents of beautiful natural areas, pikas have been shown to be vulnerable to environmental changes in some areas. These factors have motivated diverse volunteers to participate in pika watches, from hikers and outdoor enthusiasts to K-12 students and teachers. Cascades Pika Watch (CPW) is a citizen-science initiative supported by the Oregon Zoo, the Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium, and several leading pika biologists. In the last five years, USFS has trained over 1,000 volunteers to conduct pika surveys throughout the Cascades, including scientifically-selected sites in the continentally unique, low-elevation habitat of the Columbia River Gorge (CRG). USDA’s experience is that CPW volunteers enjoy being involved in this project. The active CPW Facebook group has over 500 members who enthusiastically share pika pictures and stories, accessible at: https://www.facebook.com/groups/CascadesPikaWatch/. Post-participation surveys also suggest that this project encourages a sense of stewardship and responsibility among the outdoor enthusiasts as well as a deepened awareness of the complexity of wildlife management and conservation.","The project started in July 2018, and is ongoing.","The project is located in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area of Hood River, OR.","The project targeted youth groups from historically marginalized communities; outdoor enthusiasts; urban and rural families; and K-12 teachers/students. The total number of individuals involved during this period was 103 volunteers, and the average number of active participants was 71 volunteers per month. The total number of volunteer hours was 868 total.",All participants involved in the project during this reporting period provided consent.,A total of 96 data sheets containing wildlife observations and site data were submitted.,"Funding for CCS projects comes from congressionally appropriated dollars to USDA. There is no dedicated budget line item or funding by USDA for citizen science and crowdsourcing. In FY18, 0.02 FTE and $26,815 supported the project coordinator and technical advisor, travel for trainers, training events, and cooperator and agency indirect costs.",Federal partners included U.S. Geological Survey Northern Rocky Mtn. Science Center. Non-Federal partners included the Oregon Zoo and Colorado Mesa University.,"The pika is currently listed as a Species of Conservation Concern (SCC) in numerous U.S. Forest Service units. Forest Service SCC’s are defined as species “for which population viability is a concern, as evidenced by: 1) Significant current or predicted downward trends in population numbers or density. 2) Significant current or predicted downward trends in habitat capability that would reduce a species’ existing distribution” (Forest Service Manual [FSM] 2670.5.19). Relatively little is known about how CRG pikas might respond to contemporary environmental changes and disturbances caused by wildfire. This knowledge gap may hamper management, given that fires are predicted to increase in both frequency and severity. Through citizen science, CPW provides an early-warning system to inform the USFS about changes in pika populations. In the future, trained CPW volunteers can apply their skills to monitor pikas and other species in areas beyond the CRG, using protocols, apps, and techniques in which they have been trained. Most importantly, this project provides a wealth of data on multiple ecosystem components and fire, across a large area spanning two states, at effectively zero cost to USFS. Cost-efficiencies are created by our existing extensive network of volunteers, and process-efficiencies reflect diverse partners that this project unites towards common, multi-faceted goals.","Experience in this project demonstrates that volunteers can collect high-quality data to inform management. An active social media presence is also being used to spread relevant information to participants and the community. Finally, this effort will ensure a continuous supply of trained citizen scientists for monitoring other species in the future. In addition, to share findings most widely, at least two peer-reviewed publications are anticipated describing both the immediate impact of the ECF on the CRG pika population and the factors underlying short-term declines and subsequent recovery.","Data will be freely available to management agencies following peer-reviewed publication, allowing these agencies (e.g., USFS, USFWS) to make evidence-based decisions on how to manage pikas and their habitat. In addition, results will be shared through presentations to zoo visitors, schools, and through social media."
Neighbors to Nature: Cache Creek Study,USDA Forest Service,CCS Authority,"This project will expand a partnership between the Forest Service, Friends of Pathways (FOP), Jackson Hole (JH) Wildlife Foundation, and Wildflower Watch through the use of citizen science to better inform land management decisions in the heavily used Cache Creek drainage, directly adjacent to the town of Jackson, Wyoming. The project will engage a youth crew from FOP, citizen scientists/volunteers from the JH Wildlife Nature Mapping program, and existing volunteers from Wildflower Watch to collect, analyze and interpret plant, wildlife, and trail use data. This project will help establish a baseline of observations, as well as an effective and consistent method to gather and process this data over time. Phenological observations such as leaf-out, budding, and flowering of plant species will help monitor the effects of climate change on plant communities with subsequent implications for seasonal recreation use. Approximately ten species of native and invasive plants will be located and monitored by volunteers. Trail counters will be purchased and installed in key locations to observe how the area is being utilized for recreation. Nature Mapping volunteers, as well as the FOP youth crew, will directly observe and report on wildlife movements in the area. Data will then be analyzed by volunteers and provided to the public and the Forest Service to inform future management decisions in the area.","Aside from informing and improving Forest Service management decisions, much of the value of this collaboration lies in the education of the local community. An educated community is more likely to comply with and support management decisions such as seasonal area or trail closures for wildlife. FOP will engage students in this project through the involvement of their youth crew, who will help install and rotate trail counters and wildlife cameras, as well as upload data into existing databases. This helps students understand data collection standards and the scientific method. Wildflower Watch will engage volunteers through direct monitoring of native and invasive flora and fauna of the forest, getting volunteers outside and participating in rigorous research efforts. Citizen scientists will also be encouraged to participate in data entry, analysis, and interpretation through additional outreach efforts led by the Wildflower Watch team. USFS hopes that participation in this project by the public will create a large community centered on the appreciation of natural resources.","The project started on May 17, 2018, and is ongoing.","The project is located in the Bridger-Teton National Forest (BTNF) Jackson Ranger District in Jackson, WY.","The project targeted outdoor recreationists, citizen scientists, Teton County Middle School, Teton Science School, the Teton Chapter of the Native Plants Society, Teton Botanical Garden, and the Sierra Club. The total number of individuals involved during this period was 50. Participants were all going out once a week, from mid-June to mid-September into the project study area to record observations. The total number of volunteer hours for this project is 135 hours.",All of the volunteers have signed volunteer agreements.,"Participants were asked to collect data on plant phenology, for which roughly 100 observations were collected. Participants were also asked to collect data on wildlife sightings, for which 141 observations were collected. This adds to a total of 241 observations taken.","Funding for CCS projects comes from congressionally appropriated dollars to USDA. There is no dedicated budget line item or funding by USDA for citizen science and crowdsourcing. In FY18, 0.05 FTEs and $27,440 were used to support grant administration; staff time; project management; data analysis; stipend for the youth crew; youth crew manager and foreman; web development contractor; and equipment (e.g., wildlife cameras, field guides, lenses, clipboards, printed materials, trail counters).","Non-Federal partners included the JH Wildlife Foundation, Wildflower Watch, and FOP.","From a recreation perspective, this project will add value to local resource management by providing an accurate, scientific view of the plant and wildlife populations in the area, and the associated recreational use patterns. Aside from informing and improving USFS management decisions, much of the value lies in the education of the local community. An educated community is more likely to comply with and support management decisions such as seasonal area or trail closures for wildlife. This directly reduces operating costs for the agency by reducing the number of field patrols and amount of signage that are necessary to maintain closures. Additionally, knowledge of the recreational patterns directly increases efficiency of the USFS unit by informing rangers and trail workers about the areas needing the most attention. From a range perspective, understanding how species composition may be altered in response to climate change will help in predicting community vulnerability to phase or state change within current ecological site descriptions. This could make risk assessments associated with proposed management activities more accurate; thus leading to better informed decisions, improved project design, and increased efficiency.","The USFS Jackson District Trail Assessment was prepared to more effectively manage recreation use by establishing desired conditions for nine geographical areas on the District. The Cache Creek recreation area was further split into four zones to more closely monitor conditions and provide a diverse range of experiences close to town. This project will directly inform recreation managers of existing conditions compared with desired conditions. Additionally, this project aims to initiate citizen science observations of phenology for approximately ten species of flowering plants at Cache Creek, contributing to the greater efforts of the USA National Phenological Network (USANPN).","FOP will integrate trail counter data into an existing database which currently stores three years of trail count data. FOP provides a direct link to this database for managers and the public to see on their website. USFS plans to upload all phenological data to the USANPN database, which is quality assured and open source, to be easily accessed by managers, researchers, and the general public. Wildflower Watch will also keep a backup database of all field collections for use internally at the BTNF and for local partners including researchers, citizen scientists, and school groups. Wildlife data will be composed of observations made anywhere within the project area at any time. The dataset contains data collected since 2009 to the present day. Data going into the NMJH database under casual observations will be shared with the Wyoming Game & Fish Department’s Wildlife Observation System to augment State data."
Potomac Highlands Cooperative Weed and Pest Management Area Non-Native Invasive Species Citizen Science Program,USDA Forest Service,CCS Authority,"For the last seven years, the Potomac Highlands Cooperative Weed and Pest Management Area (PHCWPMA) has delivered a successful citizen science program for fifth graders at an elementary school in Grant County, West Virginia. After a four-week series of lessons about local non-native invasive species (NNIS) in the classroom, the students apply what they have learned on a day-long field trip to identify, map, and remove NNIS on the Monongahela National Forest. With the support of the CitSci Fund, the PHCWPMA plans to purchase additional educational materials, expand the program to other schools in and around the Monongahela National Forest, and use the latest technology for gathering and sharing NNIS data. Working with teachers, these activities have been correlated with the Next Generation Content Standards and Objectives for the State of West Virginia. The PHCWPMA will continue working with students in Grant County and expand to students in Pocahontas, Fayette, Greenbrier, and Hardy counties by 2019, serving primarily rural and low-income students.","Currently, a successful version of this program already exists through the PHCWPMA partnership at another elementary school. Expansion of the project to more schools will allow for students to be engaged that come from an area in West Virginia that is primarily rural and low-income. This project creates public engagement and learning/training opportunities in the classroom and field trip into the forest where the students will use what they have learned to identify and be land stewards by removing NNIS.","The project started in FY18, and is ongoing.","The project is located in the Monongahela National Forest in Elkins, WV.","The project targeted middle school-age students from schools located in or near the Monongahela National Forest.

The students would directly contribute to this target and improve the forest by recording and voluntarily removing the NNIS on field trips. An important part of reporting to the Forest Service is recording the spatial data of area treated. By using the EDDMapS application, students would provide ArcGIS data to the Forest Service and other interested parties. Having this spatial data will allow for field crews or other volunteers to come in later to finish removal. This recorded data would also provide more information and greater efficiency for the PHCWPMA field crew so that they can better prioritize their efforts based on the location and extent of NNIS populations.",This will improve USFS’s data management for NNIS and allow retrieval of spatial data from the website; it qualifies for the USFS’s targets for national reporting.,"The students will use tablets to collect and store information using the EDDMapS application. The data are accessible by the public, scientists, and other NNIS specialists; such spatial data were not previously available to the Forest Service for the reporting of NNIS treatment and removal. Specifically, they can assist The Nature Conservancy of West Virginia, in partnership with the Monongahela National Forest, in directing their PHCWPMA field crew specializing in weed and pest management to sites that are in need of treatment for NNIS."
Tracking the Vernal Window with a Low-Cost Instrumentation Suite,USDA Forest Service,CCS Authority,"The vernal window marks the end of winter and the start of the growing season, defined as the time between snowmelt and canopy closure. Weather variability in winter and spring could lengthen the vernal window and impact forest ecosystem functions such as nutrient and water cycling. A changing vernal window could affect economic activities that requires frozen conditions (i.e., winter logging) or snowmelt and soil thaw (i.e., maple sugaring). Additional research is needed to understand how the vernal window responds to changes in snow, soil frost, soil biological activity, and canopy green-up, and could affect forest management and long-term forest health. The goal of this project is to enhance collective understanding of the vernal window by providing New England high schools with low-cost instrumentation to track changes in 1) snow depth, 2) soil frost depth, 3) soil biological activity, and 4) forest canopy green-up. Participants are recruited from the established Community Collaborative Rain Hail and Snow Network (CoCoRaHS) and train students to measure soil frost via the frost tube method, soil biological activity using soda lime base traps, and canopy green-up by observing phenophases.",Classrooms are an ideal venue for this research because the vernal window coincides with school semesters and engages students in outdoor scientific inquiry. Data will be synthesized in an open-source framework that will allow classrooms to track changes in the vernal window using a lesson plan that meets Next Generation Science Standards.,"The project started in FY18, and is ongoing.","The project is located in Durham, NH.",The project targeted five high school (grades 9-12) classrooms. Two New England teachers have been recruited and three more high schools in New England will be recruited by the end of spring 2018 from a network of teachers in the community.,"No volunteer hours have been recorded yet, so no consent was needed.",N/A,"Funding for CCS projects comes from congressionally appropriated dollars to USDA.

A coordinated effort has been underway since 2008 to improve the discussion of climate change in National Environmental Policy Act analysis and decision-making on the WMNF. Winter recreation is important to the regional economy and the management of the WMNF. Increased attention has been going into infrastructure-related issues associated with stream crossings (roads and trails) largely because of the increased frequency of events, such as rain-on-snow that result in major floods. The WMNF is focusing attention to snowmobile trails (400 miles on the WMNF) as many current routes are over wetlands or other water bodies which are no longer reliably freezing. The WMNF is also investing in trail reroutes and better crossing designs on both nordic ski and snowmobile trails across the unit as funding permits. More attention needs to be paid to snow related issues particularly in regards to snowmobiling and cross country skiing, both sports which are not supported by artificial snow making.","Increasing evidence suggests that variability in winter snow and soil frost dynamics exerts important controls on wintertime root and microbial activity and nutrient loss from soils, which in turn affect forest health. More information on the relationships among snow depth, soil frost, and soil CO2 efflux (a proxy for winter soil biological activity) can help inform our understanding of how winter weather influences forest productivity. Winter conditions, including duration of snowpack and frozen soil, are also important determinants of forest operations planning. Snow and soil frost control winter access for timber harvest, and predictable timing of frozen ground and snowmelt is important for the safety and efficiency of harvest operations. Additionally, sap flow necessary for maple syrup production requires a combination of warm days and freezing nights that is highly seasonal. Weather records show such conditions now occur earlier than in the past and this trend is projected to continue; however, it is unclear whether the season will be shortened or sap yield reduced. Maple producers report that their current ability to adapt to changing weather conditions is largely related to the health of the forest and the ability of producers to adopt new technologies.","Classrooms will follow the existing National Phenology Network Nature's notebook reporting protocols to track three phenophases: breaking leaf buds, leaves, increasing leaf size of trees in outdoor classrooms. Trees will include maple, oak, and poplar, subject to availability on school grounds. Participating classrooms will receive in-class training in the fall and follow-up data analysis sessions in late spring. All data will be uploaded to GoogleSpreadsheets. The research team will perform quality assurance and quality control on the data, and develop scripts to process data into graphs, and made publicly available via a GitHub repository. Researchers and teachers will create a comprehensive Vernal Window Teacher Guide including protocol training slides, datasheets, content presentations, analysis instructions, and a comprehensive equipment list to implement in other classrooms across the Northeastern U.S. Snow depth and phenophase data are available at www.cocorahs.org and www.naturesnotebook.org, respectively. The proposed project will centralize the above vernal window indicators in a single open-access GitHub repository for other educators, managers, researchers, and the general public."
Urban Heat Island Mapping Campaign,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),CCS Authority,"On two of the hottest days of summer in 2018 (August 21–23), a NOAA-sponsored team of scientists and volunteer citizen scientists conducted a field campaign to measure and map the urban heat islands of Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland. The campaign had three main objectives: (1) produce very detailed heat maps of D.C. and Baltimore, quantifying the heat differences across the cities; (2) provide residents and city officials with a resource for assessing the risks from extreme heat and identifying the necessary actions to protect people, property, and infrastructure; and (3) improve understanding of the changes in temperature of those urban heat islands through the course of an entire day as a function of different land cover types. Citizen scientist volunteers also participated in a pilot urban heat island mapping campaign, funded by a NOAA Environmental Literacy Grant, in Richmond, VA, on July 13, 2017. Hosted by the Science Museum of Virginia, the mapping effort showed that temperature differences of up to 16°F occurred during the same time of day in different parts of the city.  The campaign also found that the orgins of the majority of heat stress-related 911 emergency calls coincided with the locations of the city's heat islands. Thus, city residents and officials are using these findings to begin a new dialog about actions that can be incorporated into the city's long-term master plan to protect its citizens from extreme heat. The full Richmond urban heat island mapping case study can be found at https://toolkit.climate.gov/case-studies/where-do-we-need-shade-mapping-urban-heat-islands-richmond-virginia.","The decision to utilize a citizen science approach to the Urban Heat Island Mapping Campaign was justified by the scope, design, and nature of the experiment. To achieve the campaigns goals, temperature measurements, taken simultaneously every second all over both cities for three one-hour periods, needed to be collected. This very high-resolution data in both time and space could not have been collected without volunteer drivers. In addition, the experiment needed to be flexible enough to wait for clear, very hot (?95°F) days, so participants needed to be available in two days notice. Lastly, local citizens want to ensure a high quality of life in the places where they live, work, and play. Thus, local volunteer citizen scientists take ownership of the resulting temperature maps and are likelier to have a vested interest in ensuring that these maps are considered and used by city government officials in their long-range planning.","The project took place between August 20, 2018 and August 23, 2018, and is complete.","The project is located in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland.","The project targeted local citizens from D.C. and Baltimore. The total number of individuals involved during this period was 29, with 9 citizens from D.C. and 20 citizens from Baltimore. The total number of volunteer hours was approximately 85.",Twenty-nine participants provided consent during this period.,"Participants were asked to mount thermocouple devices, which were specially designed thermometers in modified PVC pipes, in their front, passenger side windows. These devices measured temperature once per second as well as the precise time of day and precise latitude and longitude location. Participants drove three one-hour traverses through D.C. and Baltimore on selected, very hot days, resulting in the collection of about 75,000 data points throughout both cities.","A one-time allocation of $30,000 was dedicated in FY17 to cover costs of conducting the Urban Heat Island Mapping Campaign in D.C. and Baltimore. Funds were used to support the work and responsibilities of the principal investigators, including equipment preparation, travel, training workshops, data analysis, and documentation of findings. Less than 0.5 FTEs were needed to support the campaign. Other resources required for the campaign included equipment (e.g., thermocouples, PVC pipes, data loggers, and GPS sensors), specialized software, and LIDAR data.","Non-Federal partners included Portland State University, Science Museum of Virginia, Smithsonian Institution, Baltimore Aquarium, D.C. and Baltimore city governments, and Casey Trees.","NOAA’s mission is to share scientific data and information to help the nation plan and respond to environmental hazards. NOAA hosts and maintains the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit with the intent to help communities, businesses, and government organizations understand their exposure to climate-related hazards and assess the actions needed to adapt to or mitigate the consequences of these hazards. The urban heat island mapping campaign contributed to this mission by helping citizens and government officials in D.C. and Baltimore with precisely measuring and mapping their urban heat islands, which can get anywhere from 15°F-20°F hotter than other areas on the hottest days of summer. With a greater understanding of the likelihood and consequences of extreme heat, residents and leaders can properly weigh the risks and identify effective prevention efforts.","NOAA intends to publish the resulting heat maps in the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit’s Climate Explorer, a web-based mapping and graphing tool.

FEMA Crowdsourcing Unit and Playbook for Emergency Management,Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),CCS Authority,"The goal of the project was to develop a playbook outlining how to leverage crowdsourcing networks that support decision making and response during disasters and emergencies for all levels of emergency management. This includes how the agency organizes information required for decision making and the types of crowdsourced data available to support those requirements. Combined with an outline of our Digital Volunteer Network (DVN) partners and the platforms used to share data, the playbook provides a roadmap on how to be successful when operating in the crowdsourcing space.","Crowdsourcing has evolved to a point where groups of individuals armed with unique skills have self-organized into networks with a mission to leverage data from the crowd to drive positive outcomes. Some networks are well established with well-codified organizational structures and mission sets while others are ad-hoc, organized at time of incident in response to a perceived gap in operations (e.g., the numerous networks organized to identify people in need of rescue during the 2017 hurricane season). This self-organizing of crowdsourcing networks has proven to be an opportunity for emergency managers. Previously, crowdsourcing meant dedicating analytical data and application development capabilities to the effort, which for most emergency managers is either in short supply or non-existent. DVNs facilitate collaboration among thousands of individuals with those precise capabilities. Instead of performing the crowdsourcing, emergency managers can leverage the efforts of DVNs who provide exponentially more robust capabilities than any single emergency management agency could expect to provide. The key is understanding how DVNs operate, why they operate, what their capabilities are, and how to collaborate for mutually beneficial outcomes.","The project started on March 01, 2018, and is ongoing.",The project is located across U.S. states and territories.,"The project targeted FEMA, self-organizing crowdsourcing networks, DNVs, and National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disasters.

Non-Federal partners included various digital volunteer networks/coordinators.,"The unprecedented disaster response requirements experienced during the 2017 hurricane season, particularly in Puerto Rico, led to gaps and delays in gaining critical information necessary to inform operational decision making. As a result, FEMA made the decision to actively participate in ongoing crowdsourcing efforts occurring outside of the Federal Government in order to close these information gaps. Information attained through crowdsourced efforts was used as a placeholder until information obtained through official, vetted sources was available. Crowdsourced information was analyzed and proven highly accurate, nullifying the organizational concern that unofficial information sources were inherently inaccurate. Most recently, FEMA utilized crowdsourcing information for leadership decision making prior to and during the landfall of Hurricane Florence.",Still under development.,Still under development.

The goal of Project eTrout is to engage students in fish biology research using VR and crowdsourcing platforms to generate data for ecological analysis by USGS while achieving educational objectives for participants. The pilot project will take place from 2018 to 2019 and entails 3 steps: (1) USGS researchers collect underwater, 360-video from targeted stream sites in Shenandoah National Park and provide video samples to participating schools; (2) participants watch video samples and collect data on trout abundance, behavior, and habitat use; and (3) USGS summarizes the crowdsourced data and reports results back to participants. This project provides a powerful new link between ecological research and education by enabling fish biology research across large regions while providing students and citizen scientists a new way to experience stream ecosystems. This effort could be expanded to include video collection by visitors to National Forests and National Parks as well as NGO partners at the national and international level.","Stream ecosystems are spatially complex and therefore an understanding of stream fishes requires data from many locations. Collection of such spatially-distributed data is not feasible by any single agency or university alone. Instead, stream ecosystems require a collaborative effort across many institutions for analysis at the landscape scale.

Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 is also the deepest all-sky infrared search for new planets in the solar system, such as the proposed Planet Nine.","The deepest WISE brown dwarf search prior to this project involved visual inspection of roughly one million images. Thus, NASA recognized that volunteer help with the inspection process would be necessary to go deeper.","The project started on February 14, 2017 and is ongoing.",Participation in the project is available globally through internet access.,"The project targeted the general public. The total number of individuals involved during this period was estimated to be 150,000. However, estimation is based on IP addresses that have accessed the site, so the exact number of participants is difficult to measure. The average number of active participants per day was between 50 and 60. The total number of volunteer hours was 83,000 hours for the classification work on the Zooniverse site alone, plus approximately the same among of time for the effort contributed by the advanced user group on various side projects.",All participants consented to participate.,The project has received roughly 5 million online classifications of image sets from NASA’s Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission and Near Earth Asteroid-WISE (NEOWISE) project.,"In FY17 and FY18, the project was supported by NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (80%) and NASA’s Office of the Chief Scientist/Science Innovation Fund (20%). Extramural funding for FY17 totaled $35,000, and 0.35 internal FTEs supported the project. Extramural funding for FY18 totaled $6,000, and 0.25 internal FTEs supported the project. Both FY17 and FY18 FTEs have gone to support labor for the principal investigator. In addition to providing funding to Zooniverse (zooniverse.org) to develop and use the Zooniverse platform for this project, the project took advantage of a project builder tool Zooniverse has made available at no charge. Additional funding has been used for publication costs and travel.","Non-Federal partners include Zooniverse, American Museum of Natural History, Arizona State University, University of Oklahoma, University of Montreal, UC San Diego, and Bucknell University.",The project addresses NASA’s mission to understand the solar system and the universe by finding ultracool brown dwarfs and searching for new planets orbiting the sun.,This project is used to advance scientific understanding and has been cited in a scientific journal publication.,"The final list of brown dwarfs discovered by the project will be published in the scientific literature. NASA also plans to create a public archive of potentially useful false positives (e.g., active galactic nuclei, M dwarfs) for use by future astronomers. This archive will be hosted by the NASA/ Infrared Processing & Analysis Center Infrared Science Archive."
Landslide Reporter,NASA,CCS Authority,"Historical data on landslide events are vital for landslide hazard and risk assessment and response. However, there is currently a dearth of information at the global scale of when and where landslides occur. Landslide Reporter is a web application that invites citizen scientists to contribute landslides, mudslides, rockfalls, and other events to the NASA Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository (COOLR) to help build the largest open global landslide catalog. When a citizen scientist finds a landslide in an online news source or sees a landslide in person, they can describe its location, type of landslide, and more details and submit it for review. Their submissions are checked and added to the repository. The COOLR project extends from the NASA Global Landslide Catalog (GLC), an open global catalog of rainfall-triggered landslides compiled by members of the Hydrological Sciences Laboratory at Goddard Space Flight Center since 2007. The goal of Landslide Reporter is to improve the quality and quantity of landslide data globally, to be a tool and resource for local communities to use to monitor and research landslides, and for collective landslide reporting during disasters. Lastly, Landslide Reporter strives to be an educational resource to increase the public’s awareness and knowledge about landslides as a hazard.","Although landslides occur frequently, many landslides go unreported by newspapers or are grouped together with other natural hazards. Thus, people over a wide geographic range are needed to better capture an accurate count of landslides. The massive collection of data from citizen scientists increases the robustness of NASA’s global landslide efforts farther than possible with the team at Goddard Space Flight Center alone. NASA’s previous methodology for the Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) limited the collection of landslide reports to those found with Google Alerts and by the time availability of scientists and interns in NASA’s laboratory. Citizen science enables the amassing of information from many different sources, including local first-hand accounts, reports in non-English languages, and points from other inventories, and lessens the data collection bias. Citizen scientists have a better local understanding of their region, which may result in improved accuracy of the location and details of the landslide. Citizen science also enables more hands to collect reports, leading to a more up-to-date inventory and less reliance on the availability of the landslides team. Lastly, a citizen-aided effort creates more awareness and education about landslides as a natural process and natural/man-made hazard. From the initial findings, citizen scientists are already bringing in new data from areas that have been underreported in the past with great accuracy and detail.","The project started on March 22, 2018 and is ongoing.",The project collects information on a global scale.,"The project targeted the general public with at least a high school education. The total number of individuals involved during this period was 35, which reflects the total number of participants that have successfully contributed reports. The total number of volunteer hours was 43 hours, assuming each of the 129 submitted landslide reports took an average of 20 minutes to complete.","All participants are required to agree to the Posting, Privacy, and Takedown Policy before using Landslide Reporter.","Citizen scientists are asked to mark where a landslide occurred on a map and fill in information about the date, time, description, type, trigger, fatalities and injuries, and surrounding environment of the landslide. Only the location and source of the event are required to complete the submission. A total of 129 landslide reports have been submitted.","Total project funding for FY17 and FY18 was approximately $186,000. The funds came from several different sources, but there is not one single funding source specifically designated to support this project. The funding has been acquired through the Presidential Early Career Achievement Award (PECASE), an “Innovation Seedling on Citizen Science” award ($19,000) from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center’s Chief Technologist Office, NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS), and the precipitation measurement missions. All resources for this project have been used to support labor (contractor and civil servant labor), including the support received in kind from the system developer partners at NASA as well as the internal group’s effort. The FY17 resources were used to develop a first proof-of-concept for this project and back-up documentation for fields to be included. A total of 0.08 FTEs and 0.08 WYEs supported the project in FY17. FTE support and WYE support in FY17 amounted to $10,000 each. The FY18 resources were used to support one full-time contractor to develop the materials supporting this citizen science project. A total of 0.1 FTEs and 1.2 WYEs supported the project in FY18. The FTE contribution was used to manage the project, and the WYE contribution was used to develop the tools using ESRI Citizen Science applications and to support scientific oversight and testing. FTE support amounted to $10,000 and WYE support amounted to $156,000 in FY18.",N/A,"Landslide Reporter advances NASA’s mission to discover and develop Earth science datasets to better understand the Earth. With the goal to expand the consistency and accuracy of a global open landslide catalog, Landslide Reporter is aiding the discovery of the Earth by helping validate and improve NASA’s landslide modeling capabilities. Landslide Reporter also directly aids NASA’s response to the 2017–2027 Decadal Survey for Earth Science and Applications from Space, which prioritizes the “forecasting and monitoring of landslides, especially those near population centers.” Landslide Reporter fulfills NASA’s objective to inspire and engage the public in science by involving the public in contributing data towards NASA’s scientific research. In addition to learning about individual landslide events, the public becomes more knowledgeable about landslide hotspots and how landslides occur. The availability of data from Landslide Reporter can be used by citizen scientist landslide experts to conduct investigations. Furthermore, Landslide Reporter supports applications of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission, as COOLR provides validation for NASA’s Global Landslide Susceptibility Map and the Landslide Hazard Assessment for Situational Awareness (LHASA) Model, both which use GPM rainfall data for landslide susceptibility and nowcasting.","Data are quality-checked, added to COOLR, and made available to the public. Foremost, COOLR data supports the continued development of the LHASA model, which uses GPM rainfall data to make a nowcast of where landslides are most likely to occur globally. The open data can also be downloaded by anyone for other landslide research.","The data are open to the public for download or referenced from the web application, Landslide Viewer, at https://landslides.nasa.gov/viewer.

Invasive Mosquito Project,Agricultural Research Service (ARS),7 U.S.C. 2272 (Volunteers for Department of Agriculture Programs),The Invasive Mosquito Project (IMP) is a public education and national mosquito monitoring program that partners local professionals with high school teachers and community educators to teach about mosquito-borne disease and public health. The project provides teachers with educational materials that meet Next Generation Science Standards and creates community outreach opportunities that benefits mosquito control and public health agencies. The IMP website serves as both an informational resource and a connection platform for teachers and professionals.,"During the summer of 2012, the USDA sampled mosquitoes throughout the entire continental United States using a network of citizen scientists and crowdsourcing. Learning from the effectiveness of this effort, the IMP was formed to make an even larger and more sustainable network at lower cost.",The project started in April 2016 and is ongoing.,The IMP monitors invasive mosquito species across the United States.,"The project targeted middle and high school students, boy scouts, master gardeners, and other community groups. The total number of individuals involved during this period was 2000, and the number of active participants was 50.",No consent is needed.,"The IMP collected participant observation data as well as mosquito eggs, mosquito larvae, and adult mosquito samples.","There is no dedicated budget to support the IMP. However, the use of crowdsourcing and citizen science (CCS) allows USDA-ARS to support the project. By relying on citizens for monitoring and data collection, USDA-ARS saves approximately $15,000 per year in technician travel and equipment related costs. The project costs to raise the mosquitoes is approximately $2,000 per year and 0.1 FTE of a technician. Both FY17 and FY18 resources were used to rear the submitted mosquito egg samples to adults for identification.",Non-Federal partners included Kansas State University.,"The USDA uses the submitted mosquito samples for population genetics studies, helping to raise awareness about public health risks through agricultural research.","In addition to helping teach students and communities about the risk of mosquito transmitted pathogens and building a strong network of schools, the IMP allowed the USDA to find the origins and subsequent geographic expansion of two mosquito species in the United States. The USDA is in the process of using the samples to determine which traits are needed for population expansion to new geographic areas, which will help predict future at risk populations.",The data is currently maintained as paper records and is not available at this time.
Collaborative Adaptive Rangeland Management (CARM),ARS,7 U.S.C. 2272 (Volunteers for Department of Agriculture Programs),"The CARM study was devised to compare traditional rangeland management used by local ranches with season-long, continuous grazing. A team of stakeholders and scientists were selected to manage yearling cattle for beef production, grassland diversity, and bird conservation. For the experiment, approximately 230 yearling cattle graze 10 130-hectare pastures from mid-May to October; and researchers measure outcomes on grassland birds, vegetation composition and structure, cattle production, and social learning. Decisions to be determined include pasture sequence (what order a pasture is grazed or rested), when to move cattle between pastures, and vegetation management actions (e.g. prescribed burning). Decisions are based on monitoring data and stakeholders’ local knowledge. This project is the core common experiment for the USDA-ARS Central Plains Experimental Range Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network. The first stakeholder group meetings were held in 2012, and the experimental baseline sampling began in 2013. Treatments were initiated in 2014 and have been ongoing, with the intent to continue for at least 5 more years.",The use of citizen science in this study demonstrates how science can be conducted in a real-world manner. Local ranchers across the region are the ultimate end users of the information to be gained from these studies.  Engaging a group of local ranchers in the research and data collection helps ensure that the data and analyses are relevant and applicable to managers throughout the region.  By allowing the ranchers to engage in the data collection also effectively expands the study area and the number of samples to be analyzed.,The project started in 2012 and is ongoing.,The study is focused in the rangelands of the western Great Plains of North America.,"The project targeted stakeholders of complex rangeland systems, including ranchers, public land managers, conservation organizations, and nongovernmental organizations. The total number of individuals involved during this period was 225, with 164 field day participants, 11 CARM project participants, and approximately 50 guests from associated organizations. The active CARM project participants included 11 CARM stakeholders, 9 non-ARS scientists, and 4 graduate students. The total number of volunteer hours for FY17 and FY18 was 1,400. Volunteer hours only include the hours of persons not employed by an organization where their time was covered.",All active participants provided consent.,"Submissions for the CARM study include observations of cattle behavior, grassland birds, and vegetation. CARM stakeholders planned and excuted the Field Day last fiscal year.","FY17 and FY18 funding, not including full-time equivalent (FTE) time, totaled $425,000 and $450,000, respectively.

In FY17, $117,000 and $115,000 in funding came from the two grants. USDA-ARS base funds support approximately 8 FTEs from ARS, with about 4 FTEs in Scientist Year and technician time and 4 FTEs in summer students. USDA-ARS base funds also are used through Non-Assistance Cooperative Agreements (NACAs) to support graduate students addressing livestock behavior, economics, ecosystem modeling, and livestock diet selection and quality. USDA-ARS base funds have been used for (1) sample analyses (soils, fecal material, and diet quality); (2) monitoring networks of soil, climate and greenhouse gas fluxes; (3) infrastructure maintenance and upgrades (livestock facilities, fencing, roads, vehicles, and communcation networks); (4) data management and storage; and (5) travel to producer and professional meetings.

FarmLab,ARS,7 U.S.C. 2272 (Volunteers for Department of Agriculture Programs),"The FarmLab is a new initiative of the U.S. Dairy Forage Research Center, based at the Prairie du Sac research farm. The FarmLab will serve as a farm-scale laboratory for study of the long-term economic, environmental, and social outcomes associated with land use and farming practices. The FarmLab has three priority research areas: (1) soil health; (2) biological diversity; and (3) farm systems research. Efforts will explore the relationships between land cover, land management, soil health (nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, water infiltration, erosion, soil biota), biodiversity (genetic, species, landscape), and  the production of commodities and ecosystem services, examine the social, economic, agronomic, and ecological trade-offs associated with farming practices, and provide decision-making tools and support for producers.","Several reasons serve as justification for engaging citizens in the data collection, land stewardship, ecological restoration, and outreach programming aspects of the FarmLab project. The long history of public engagement in the reuse of the former Badger Army Ammunition Plant, of which the U.S. Dairy Forage Research Center’s Prairie du Sac research station is a part, provides a foundation for a successful citizen science program. Citizen engagement in matters of agricultural research is especially important for informing the public about the challenges and opportunities agricultural producers face in managing economically and environmentally sustainable agricultural operations. Researchers hear and integrate farmers’ concerns and expertise into research design, and farmers hear researchers’ expertise and experiences in investigating issues of agricultural sustainability. Engaging agricultural producers in ARS research through farmer-citizen science and outreach events then provides a means of direct communication between researchers and practitioners and builds trust around research design, implementation, and practicality of farm management recommendations.",The project started in 2017 and is ongoing.,The FarmLab is located on former Badger Army Ammunition Plant lands in Wisconsin.,"The project targeted citizens interested in stewardship activities.

CrowdMag,NOAA,"Coast and Geodetic Survey Act, 33 U.S.C. § 883a et seq.","In partnership with the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) started a crowdsourcing project to collect vector magnetic data from digital magnetometers in smartphones. The aim is to distill meaningful magnetic data from a large number of noisy measurements and use these data to fill gaps in the coverage of global geomagnetic data. Data from a typical phone gives the three components of the local magnetic field with a sensitivity of about 150 to 600 nanotesla (nT), although newer phones are becoming more accurate. Smartphones combine  magnetic data  and accelerometer data to determine the phone’s orientation. CrowdMag uses the phone’s internet connection to send magnetic and location data to NCEI.  NOAA checks the quality of the magnetic data from all users and makes the data available to the public as aggregate maps. Currently, the CrowdMag project has about 28,000 enthusiastic users who have contributed more than 31 million magnetic data points from around the world.",Professionally collecting magnetic data at urban and local (<20 km) resolution is prohibitively expensive. Modern smartphones come with digital magnetometer for pedestrian navigation. Citizen-scientists contributing magnetic data from their phones using CrowdMag technology is a cost-effective way to improve NCEI’s high-resolution magnetic data coverage.,The project started in January 2015 and is ongoing.,Data is collected on a global scale.,"The project targeted any interested member of the public with a smartphone. The project has had 36,850 application installs (19,150 Android and 17,700 iOS) since inception. A total of 8,342 installs (5,192 Android and 3,150 iOS) occurred in FY17 and 15,171 installs (5,521 Android and 9,650 iOS) occurred in FY18. The average number of active participants at any time was about 7,000.",Consent to send data to NOAA is received by all participants upon installation of the application.,"Submission information includes the time stamp, location information (latitude, longitude), location accuracy (in meters), magnetic data (in nano-Tesla), and phone’s make (e.g., iPhone 5.2).","CrowdMag has never received dedicated funding, and the funding has come from small, one-time grants and general funding to the CIRES geomagnetic group. Minimal support from a NOAA software engineer is used to maintain the CrowdMag database hosted at NCEI-CO (0.01 FTE per year). The CrowdMag project uses an NCEI web server and a database system to gather data and host its website, which requires 0.15 FTE of a CIRES Research Scientist and 0.2 FTE of a CIRES professional research associate.",Non-Federal partners include the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the University of Colorado.,"NCEI is the national archive for geomagnetic data and information with primary roles in geomagnetic research and modeling. NCEI uses magnetic data collected by observatories, satellites, and ship/airborne surveys to develop magnetic models. However, the available measurements leave gaps in coverage, particularly for crustal and man-made magnetic signal sources. CrowdMag aims to fill the gaps in magnetic data coverage by capitalizing on existing technology and citizen science. Improved magnetic data coverage will lead to better magnetic models to aid navigation. This effort will benefit NOAA, the nation, and the international community.","Since its inception in 2015, the CrowdMag app has been downloaded by more than 36,850 iOS and Android users, making it NOAA’s most downloaded mobile app. There are currently about 7,000 active CrowdMag users worldwide. Users have contributed more than 30 million magnetic data points to NOAA's CrowdMag database. CrowdMag data coverage within the contiguous United States is sufficient to identify the broad scale magnetic features of the 48 contiguous states. In the Boulder, Colorado region, the significant concentration of CrowdMag participants has enabled NOAA to make magnetic feature maps with about a 100 m grid cell resolution. Globally, NOAA has sufficient CrowdMag users to define a very coarse but global magnetic model which underscores the potential of the application for mapping the Earth’s magnetic field. The current CrowdMag user community is mainly based and sustained by word of mouth communication. However, a few presentations at international scientific meetings, a YouTube video release, and various NOAA and CIRES outreach releases have worked to publicize CrowdMag. The CrowdMag project was cited in the 2015 Colorado Governor's award for high-impact research by the NOAA/CIRES geomagnetism group. The current users consist primarily of people who already identify as STEM professionals or hobbiests. The transformation of the user base from experts to general public users will be of broad interest in the citizen science community.",CrowdMag data are saved at NCEI-CO in an internal database. The data are quality-controlled and provided to the public via ESRI web-maps.
Crowdsourced Bathymetry,"NOAA, National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)",Coast and Geodetic Survey Act of 1947,"The key to successful crowdsourced bathymetry (CSB) efforts are volunteer observers who operate vessels-of-opportunity in places where nautical charts are poor or where the seafloor is changeable and hydrographic assets are not easily available. Most ships and boats are already equipped to measure and digitally record depth in coastal waters, and the measurement capabilities of vessels have been increasing. The CSB vision is to tap into the enthusiasm for mapping the ocean floor by enabling trusted mariners to easily contribute data and augment current bathymetric coverage. The success and usefulness of this data is highly dependent on a bathymetry database, hosted by NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), with a robust infrastructure and user interface to accommodate the safe archive and distribution of the resulting data. Therefore, the main project objective has been for NCEI to provide archiving, discovery, display, and retrieval capabilities of global CSB data contributed from mariners around the world. Currently, the database contains more than 117 million points of depth data, which have been used by hydrographers and cartographers to improve nautical chart products and knowledge of the seafloor. The goal moving forward is to continue to encourage participation from the maritime community and to explore options for scalable storage as the data volumes continue to grow.","In 2014, the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), at its Fifth Extraordinary International Hydrographic Conference, recognized that traditional survey vessels alone could not be relied upon to solve data deficiency issues and agreed on the need to encourage and support all mariners in an effort to “map the gaps”. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) 1974 carriage requirements oblige all commercial vessels to be equipped with certified echo-sounders and satellite-based navigation systems. As a result, the world’s commercial fleet represents a significant, untapped source of potential depth measurements. Most non-commercial ships and boats are already equipped to measure and digitally record their depth in coastal waters, the measurement capabilities of vessels have been increasing. One outcome of the Conference was an initiative to support and enable mariners and professionally manned vessels to collect crowdsourced bathymetry (CSB) to be used as a powerful source of information to supplement the more rigorous and scientific bathymetric coverage done by hydrographic offices, industry, and researchers around the world.",The project started in 2016 and is ongoing.,Data for CSB is collected on a global scale.,The project targeted mariners and vessel operators of ships and boats in navigable waters. The total number of individuals involved was over 100.,Consent is received by all participants when the data is submitted.,"Submission include observations of water depth/bathymetry, location, and time. Approximately 2,300 data submissions have been received.","In FY17 and FY18, NOAA’s Office of Coast Survey (OCS) provided funds to NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information in order to cover salary support for a data manager, software developers, and GIS staff. Both OCS and NCEI provided FTE in-kind support to manage the project. In both FY17 and FY18, around 24 weeks of development work was required to enhance the infrastructure and interface of the CSB data repository to provide archiving, discovery, display, and retrieval of global crowdsourced bathymetry data contributed by mariners around the world. Support also covered partial salary for a data manager and in-kind FTE for database and international working group support. In FY18, a paid internship was used to program a crowdsource module intended to facilitate mariners submitting their data. Total funding was $200,000 in FY17 and $230,000 in FY18.",Federal partners include the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Non-Federal partners include the University of Colorado’s Cooperative Institute in Environmental Science and the International Hydrographic Organization.,"This project aligns with NOAA’s Office of Coast Survey Strategic Plan priority to Innovate Hydrography, which aims to expand access to data from a broad range of data sources, such as Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), satellite-derived bathymetry, and crowdsourcing, to identify chart discrepancies, update charts, inform product development, and revise hydrographic survey priorities. Enhancing NCEI’s database to accommodate the stewardship of crowdsourced bathymetry data, including data collected from AIS, will make it much easier for NOAA to attain this goal. The project directly supports the establishment of a global crowdsourced bathymetry database detailed in this OCS strategic priority. This project also aligns with NOAA/DOC priorities and corporate interests to advance data integration and services and improve decisions by transforming data capabilities to support resilient coastal communities and economies for a data-enabled economy.","The crowdsourced bathymetry database now contains more than 117 million points of depth data, which have been used by hydrographers and cartographers to improve nautical chart products and knowledge of the seafloor. NOAA, working with George Mason University, is using the database depths to assess nautical chart adequacy, determine when areas require updated survey information, and identify chart discrepancies before an incident occurs. The Canadian Hydrographic Service has also used this dataset to update several Inside Passage charts along the coastal routes stretching from Seattle, Washington, to Juneau, Alaska.","In FY18, NOAA announced the end of a testing phase for the development of a new crowdsourced bathymetry database. The public can now access the bathymetric observations and measurements from citizen science volunteers and crowdsourcing programs through the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) Data Centre for Digital Bathymetry (DCDB) Data Viewer (https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/iho_dcdb/). This operationalized database allows free access to millions of ocean depth data points. The database also serves as a powerful source of information to improve navigation products and the general knowledge about seafloors."
Steller Watch,NOAA Fisheries,Endangered Species Act,"The Steller sea lion population in Alaska began to decline in the 1970s with the steepest drops observed in the 1980s. Since 2002, eastern populations began to stabilize or recover, but those in the Aleutian Islands have continued to decline. In response, the Marine Mammal Laboratory (MML) in the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) of NOAA Fisheries began a long-term life history study. With a mark-recapture method of hot-branding sea lions and observing these sea lions throughout their lifetime, NOAA can understand the movements of the sea lions, estimate the survival and birth rates of this population, and collect information helpful for determining the cause of the continuing population decline. Unfortunately, the Aleutian Islands are extremely remote, and MML only accesses this area once a year at most. Thus, sighting these marked animals proves to be a challenge.","CCS was considered as an option to help with the burden of analyzing large sets of imagery. Rather than developing machine learning or automated techniques, operating a platform where participants can help review and classify images was found to be more efficient. In addition to the crowdsourcing website, an in-person volunteer program in the Seattle-based office hosts one to four volunteers to review images.","The project started on March 15, 2017 and is ongoing.","The sets of imagery come from the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, USA.","The project was open to participants across the world. A total of 8,163 volunteers have participated as of August 31, 2018. Anywhere from 500–2,000 classifications are completed by volunteer(s) per day. In the first year, participants saved over 300 hours of processing time.",N/A,"Participants can work on either of two workflows. These workflow activities involve looking at images (in random order) and answering one to three multiple choice questions about each image. Each single image completed by one user is called a “classification.” Several independent classifications are necessary to retire an image for that workflow.  In the first year, participants classified 340,000 images","This project was developed with NOAA High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) grant funding and receives support for the primary FTE employee. Two Federal employees were also involved in the developing and launching phases and provided continued support during FY17. There have been primarily a total of three staff involved. Future investment into the project may be beneficial or necessary to update or upgrade the process (e.g., online viewing tools, data processing). Other FTEs may be brought in to help with streamlining the image upload or data compiling processes. The website is hosted at no cost by Zooniverse.org and is operated and maintained by one FTE.",N/A.,"This public crowdsourcing website is helping achieve NOAA’s mission to conserve the endangered Steller sea lion population in Alaska. The eastern Steller sea lion population was removed from the threatened species listing in 2013 since the population showed 30 years of recovery, but the western stock continues to decline in the Aleutian Islands (Alaska). This population interacts or has potential to interact with commercially important fish species such as walleye pollock, Atka mackerel, and Pacific cod throughout its range. Steller sea lions are also a very important species to the ecosystem, and declines in this population indicate a greater problem in the ecosystem that could also impact commercially vital species.","The final results from Steller Watch are a product of many classifications. Each image is classified by 7–13 participants. Images that are deemed to have a sea lion present are ran through a secondary workflow where participants classify if there is a marked sea lion present, and if so, if the mark is readable. These classifications are then compiled to find the average answer for each image, and images with readable marked sea lions present  will be further analyzed by biologists or in-house volunteers to record sightings. These sightings will be used in a larger dataset to calculate vital rates, or survival and birth rates, of Steller sea lions in the western and central Aleutian Islands, Alaska.","The imagery and classification information collected from participants is public information, but the raw data are not publically accessible. Classifications are not intuitively informative in the raw format. When these classifications are processed by MML, sightings of marked animals from the select images can be recorded. These sightings of marked animals will be included in analysis of survival rates and birth rates of the population and published in a scientific journal or government technical memorandum. Currently, the remote camera images are not publicly available online because there is no mechanism or platform to share terabytes of high-resolution imagery online. A select set of these images can be viewed on the Steller Watch site in random order."
Hawaii Bottomfish Heritage Project: Tracing Traditions and Preserving Culture,"NOAA Fisheries, Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center","MSA NS-8; MSRA Section 318, Regional Priorities and Management Needs","The project explores how the culture, traditions, and fishing techniques for the Hawaii bottomfish fishery have evolved from Native Hawaiian populations to modern times. Documenting the bottomfish “family tree”, traditional knowledge, techniques, adaptations, culture, and traditions (e.g., fish sharing), will improve the understanding of changes in the fishery over time. Specifically, the project will allow for consideration of traditional values in management programs, improve interpretation of historical data, and ensure sustainable management for the future. The project showcases cooperative research by having people within the bottomfishing community conduct semi-structured interviews with elder fishermen to ensure that the information gathered supports improved management and passes on to future generations of the community. Local fishery knowledge is an important heritage resource often lost forever when elders in the fishing community pass away. In addition, insights gathered through this research could directly support Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) stock assessment efforts, which currently work with historical commercial catch data that is lacking in context with respect to community norms and behaviors that may have influenced fisher behavior, reporting, and targeting over time.","This social science research project relies on the contributions of Hawai?i bottomfish fishermen and Council members to ensure that the research questions would be relevant to the bottomfishing community. To further ensure participation by pioneers in the fishery and exploration of topics of greatest interest to fishermen and managers, fishermen were the primary points of contact and were trained to conduct the oral history interviews.","The project started in January 2016 and is ongoing. Participants volunteered time to help develop the research proposal, research questions, and project design.","The project is based in Hawai?i, USA.","The project targets Council members and fishermen who are leaders in the bottomfish community. The total number of individuals involved during this period was five. The total number of volunteer hours was 1,250.","Formal consent was not required. Participants assisted in enabling the formulation of research questions, proposal writing, creating and refining project design, and collecting and interpreting data.",N/A,"There is no dedicated funding or account for this project. Project partners and citizens helped write successful proposals that were funded by the Cooperative Research Grant ($44,000) and Preserve America Grant ($8,000) for participants to oversee project, assist in developing protocols, conduct interviews, travel to islands throughout Hawai?i, prepare and review video archives, transcribe videos, purchase supplies, and develop outreach products. Other Federal funds were used for staff travel to assist in interviews and reporting ($4,000), a contract to produce spotlight videos ($115,000), and a contract for data analysis ($51,000). Project partners donated a total of $40,000 worth of time in 2017 and 2018.

"Cooperative Research Provides New Data for ESA-listed Rockfish in Puget Sound, WA","NOAA Fisheries, Northwest Fisheries Science Center, Conservation Biology Division","Magnuson Stevens Act Sec 318 (Sec 318, MSA, 16 USC 1867)","The primary goal of the research program is to collect new data capable of answering questions related to the recovery of Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed rockfish in the Puget Sound (PS), WA region. Additionally, the program is broadly interested in forming working relationships with user and stakeholder groups (recreational fishing and SCUBA diving communities) within PS in order to develop recovery actions that will lead to the sustainability of these populations. The knowledge and expertise of these groups have allowed NOAA to collect new data on the life-history characteristics, population abundance, fisheries interactions and genetic structure of ESA-listed rockfish in PS. These groups have successfully helped collect specimens and data across four research projects to date. First, genetic samples of ESA-listed rockfish were collected to determine whether each species met the first criterion of the ESA, which has led to the first de-listing of a marine fish species under the ESA. Second, yelloweye rockfish were targeted, collected, and tagged with acoustic transmitters to monitor movement patterns that could provide new information relevant to the identification of critical habitat. Third, citizen scientist SCUBA surveys have begun to collect new data on the spatial and temporal distribution of young-of-year, juvenile, and adult rockfish in nearshore habitat of PS. Fourth, volunteer anglers are participating in a project targeting lingcod (a species with an active fishery that lives in similar habitats as protected rockfish) using different bait types to examine whether bycatch of rockfish can be limited during this fishery while still maintaining adequate opportunities to fish for lingcod. Each project has been successful due to the local ecological knowledge and angling expertise of these groups.","Professional charter boat captains are used to provide safe, efficient platforms for fishing and collection of biological samples across three of the projects. NOAA does not have the necessary personnel time or angling expertise within the staff at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) to collect the necessary samples, and paying for extra deck hands as professional anglers would be cost-prohibitive. Thus, NOAA has relied on the engaged recreational fishing community to volunteer their time and angling expertise on each of the fishing days. This provides a collaborative framework to work together with the recreational fishing community, learn from each other, and collect the needed samples to answer policy-relevant questions to rockfish management in the Puget Sound region. This collaboration of scientists, captains, and volunteer anglers brings together all the skills necessary to make these studies a success and provides a better understanding to the public about how these new data will be used to inform management decisions. The days on the water build strong relationships between NOAA scientists and managers and the recreational fishing community in Puget Sound. These relationships have subsequently led to the successful drafting of a Rockfish Recovery Plan for the ESA-listed species and have created an environment where the public has brought forward questions they think are relevant to the recovery of these species. NOAA has evaluated those questions and, when warranted, moved forward with subsequent research studies (e.g., rockfish bycatch project). The recovery of ESA-listed rockfish will be a long process due to their life-histories, and having a respectful and trusting relationship between the scientific, management, and stakeholder communities will help NOAA meet interim recovery goals and ultimately recover these populations such that they can be managed under normal fisheries management conditions.",The project started in April 2014 and is ongoing.,"The data for the project was collected in Puget Sound, WA.","The project targets anglers with bottomfishing experience who either know where to catch threatened and endangered rockfish or have expert angling skills. Approximately 150 volunteer anglers have participated in 104 fishing days since 2014. A total of 50 participants were involved during FY17 and FY18, with three to four volunteer anglers participating each fishing day. The total number of volunteer hours since the start of the project was approximately 3,328 hours. The total number of volunteer hours for FY17 and FY18 was approximately 1136 hours.",Consent was received by all participants.,No official submissions were collected; anglers were only asked to catch fish.,"There are no specific funding sources for this program, and all staffing is funded through base personnel funds of the scientist’s division. The NWFSC has received funding from two primary sources to carry out this work to date: NOAA’s Cooperative Research Program and NOAA’s West Coast Regional Office. The genetics study received $125,000 through the NOAA Cooperative Research Program’s annual competition for grants in the FY14 funding cycle. This funding paid for contracts to charter boat captains ($83,000), supplies and processing of genetic samples ($35,000), and travel funds for fieldwork and presentation of results ($7,000). The rockfish bycatch study received $50,000 in FY16 through a grant from NOAA’s West Coast Regional Office. This funding paid for contracts to charter boat captains ($48,000) and fishing supplies ($2,000); travel to fieldwork sites was funded out of base funds of the Division. The acoustic telemetry study was funded by two grants from NOAA’s West Coast Regional Office ($20,000 in FY15 and $8,000 in FY17). FY15 funding paid for the acoustic transmitters and acoustic releases, and FY17 funding paid for the analyses of the collected data.","Federal partners included NOAA Fisheries West Coast Regional Office. Non-Federal partners included Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife, Puget Sound Anglers, Harbor WildWatch, and REEF.","One mission of the NWFSC is to provide reliable science to help decision-makers and managers build sustainable fisheries and recover endangered and threatened species. At the time of the ESA listings of three rockfish species, there was uncertainty about the distinctness of these populations in Puget Sound relative to the outer coast. Working with knowledgable captains and expert volunteer anglers allowed NOAA to collect enough samples to answer genetic questions related to the population structure of these fish and led to two new final rulings issued by NOAA concerning them. These data filled gaps that were missing during the initial listing process. A second mission of the NWFSC is to enhance public awareness, education, and stewardship of our marine resources. Including public volunteers during data collection has provided an immeasurably valuable platform for two-way education between scientists and the public. For example, one of the most asked questions by volunteers on these fishing trips is “How old is that fish?”. Rockfish are generally long-lived, slow-growing, and slow-to-mature. A 45 cm yelloweye rockfish can be anywhere from 10–80 years old and has a 50/50 chance of being mature. When informed of this fact, anglers begin to understand that these rockfish species will have a difficult time recovering and returning to historical levels of abundance if overfished. These “on the water” moments create lasting impacts and teach the importance of responsible stewardship.","The results of the genetics study have been used for two policy decisions. First, the genetics study showed that canary rockfish collected in the Puget Sound region were not genetically different from canary rockfish collected on the outer coast of Washington state. This provided one piece of new information suggesting that canary rockfish did not meet the first criterion of the Endangered Species Act; in order to be considered a “listable unit”, a vertebrate population must be markedly different from other populations of the same species. Using this new information and considering other life history characteristics of canary rockfish (e.g., adults have been shown to move 100’s of km), NOAA’s West Coast Regional Office (WCRO) issued a final rule in 2017 to de-list canary rockfish in Puget Sound from the endangered species list. Second, the genetics study showed that yelloweye rockfish collected in the Puget Sound region were genetically different from yelloweye rockfish collected on the outer coast. This provided new information directly supporting the listing of yelloweye rockfish under the ESA. However, this new research also showed that yelloweye rockfish in Puget Sound were genetically similar to yelloweye rockfish in other inland waterways of British Columbia that were farther north of the original boundary set for the yelloweye rockfish. Thus, NOAA’s WCRO issued a final rule in 2017 to expand the geographical boundaries of the yelloweye rockfish distinct population segment to account for these new findings. Data from the movement and bycatch studies are still being analyzed and have not been used in any management decisions to date. Data collection by volunteer SCUBA divers and analyses to combine formal scientific and citizen science SCUBA surveys into models calculating population abundance have just begun and will be used to estimate the status and trends of the population going forward. These efforts will help identify if or when recovery goals have been met for these populations to downlist or delist.","Some of the data from this program is publicly available. The results from the genetics study were published in the journal Conservation Genetics (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10592-018-1060-0), and the raw genetic data has been published on the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA451040). Data collection from the rockfish bycatch study is not complete, but the results will also be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Data from the acoustic telemetry project is still being analyzed but will be published and available upon completion. Individual life history data on each collected fish is publicly available upon request in accordance with Public Access to Research Results (PARR). The only piece of information that will not be available is latitude/longitude information for each fish, as publicly providing this information is against Washington state laws."

This database serves as a web-based resource for users to easily explore and understand the current and past trends of the U.S. PV industry. The data collected are actively maintained by the contributors and are always changing to provide an evolving, up-to-date snapshot of the U.S. solar power market.","Due to the increased rate in PV installations in the United States, the best way to collect updated information on installations is to retrieve installation data from the installers and provide a platform for the public to upload their own PV installation information.

Applying Protein Databases to Crowdsourcing Structural Protein Design,"NIH, National Cancer Institute (NCI)",NIH UH2 Exploratory/Developmental Cooperative Agreement,"This project aims to significantly adapt the existing proteomics video game Foldit to incorporate big data from protein databases into computational structural protein design. This data will be used to inform the manipulation of structural components of proteins. Foldit, a scientific discovery game featuring an interactive protein manipulation interface, allows the public to contribute directly to scientific research involving the study of proteins. Previous work with Foldit has shown that with an appropriate interface and introduction, even amateur players with no formal background in biochemistry can make contributions to our knowledge of proteomics. Additionally, preliminary protein design work has shown that players can contribute to the successful redesign of existing protein enzymes. The investigators aim to build upon the existing successes of Foldit in crowdsourcing protein design by leveraging the massive amount of data on protein structures that exists in protein databases like the RCSB Protein Data Bank. By integrating this data into the mechanics of the Foldit game, researchers are hoping to both improve the tools available to the players and allow them to construct more realistic protein-like structures.","The amount of work could not have been accomplished using traditional methods. By opening up the puzzle solving game to anyone who wishes to play, the project expanded the possibilities for creating novel and creative solutions in protein folding not possible through traditional means, such as utilizing a small group of lab assistants, or running computer simulations, but instead by leveraging the creative intuition and visual processing skills of the human brain across a vast group of online volunteers.","The project started on May 1st, 2017, and is ongoing.","The project takes place online, virtually.","The project engaged anyone with a computer and internet access.

OMics Compendia Commons,"NIH, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)",Public Health Services Act,"OMiCC is a community-based, biologist-friendly web platform for analyzing annotated gene-expression data sets across multiple studies (meta-analysis) and technology platforms. The OMiCC platform can access more than 24,000 human and mouse studies from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), a database repository that houses data from high-throughput functional genomic studies. An important feature of OMiCC is that it allows users to contribute to the community by sharing meta-data essential for data collation, reuse, and (meta-) analysis across studies. Thus, users of OMiCC can reuse sample groupings and pairings created by other users to construct cross-study data sets. NIH envisions that as more users take advantage of OMiCC to perform biological hypothesis generation and discovery, more users will create and share such meta-data as well as data compendia and analyses with the biomedical research community.","The cowdsourced nature amplifies the power of the OMiCC platform. As more users use the OMiCC resource and annotate data sets, these data can be effectively transformed into biological insights.","The project started 2016 and is ongoing. The NIH OMiCC Jamboree was held in April 2016, and the OMiCC online resource was published in August 2016.","The NIH Jamboree was held in the Washington, D.C. metro area. The online database comprises information contributed by users worldwide.","Twenty-nine individuals from the Washington, D.C. metro area participated in the NIH Jamboree, and consisted of faculty, fellows, and students. Participants attended a half-day group training session on using the OMiCC platform followed by a day-long jamboree, where volunteers provided a total of 349 hours of time.

NIH envisions that as more users take advantage of OMiCC to drive biological hypothesis generation and discovery, the more they can increase the ability to obtain new and robust biological insights not discernable from the analysis of any one study. These meta-analyses can also inform the design of new experiments. Previous studies have successfully combined publicly available data from published studies to both reposition drugs and identify robust gene-expression signatures of transplant rejection, infection status, tumor subtypes, and cancer progression. Thus, OMiCC has the potential to grow organically into an increasingly rich resource to help add cross-study, meta-analysis approaches to a biologist's toolbox and thus enable more effective transformation of the increasing amounts of public data into biological insights.","Using the OMiCC platform, researchers tested the idea of using crowdsourcing for exploratory data analysis of public data sets by organizing a jamboree which was advertised to the NIH immunology community. The group focused on using OMiCC to search for and identify/annotate data from five autoimmune diseases and corresponding mouse models of these diseases. The volunteers used meta-analysis to combine data from multiple studies within OMiCC to derive (1) robust gene expression signatures for each disease (disease versus healthy control comparisons) and (2) conserved gene expression signatures across all diseases within each species (pan-disease signatures). The volunteers also examined signature conservation between human and mouse. The jamboree experiment suggests that there are potentially interesting and robust signals to be mined. Given a programming-free, didactic, community-based platform such as OMiCC, together with some upfront training on the platform, biologists with any level of bio- informatics experience can benefit from and contribute to utilizing public data for hypothesis exploration that can be translated into powerful insights about disease and biological processes.","The OMiCC platform and data are freely available to the public at https://omicc.niaid.nih.gov/.

Battle of the Atlantic Expedition,Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM),National Historic Preservation Act (NEPA),"BOEM and NOAA’s Monitor National Marine Sanctuary have committed to a multi-year project to document the Battle of the Atlantic by conducting archaeological investigations of both Axis and Allied losses during World War II offshore North Carolina. An Interagency Agreement was developed in 2010 to provide support over a five-year period toward documenting these casualties.
As the longest military campaign of World War II, the Battle of the Atlantic was waged from the waters off England to the east coast of the United States and into the Gulf of Mexico. From its beginnings in 1939 through the end of the war with Germany, hundreds of vessels were lost and are now located on the seafloor as archaeological resources. Given the violent nature of these vessel losses, many are also war graves. The area offshore North Carolina was the closest theater of war to the continental United States. This expedition has identified and investigated Axis and Allied losses in the Graveyard of the Atlantic.  The objectives of this project are to collect detailed documentation of these vessels and to develop a complete inventory of WWII losses in the region.","Crowdsourcing and citizen science techniques were selected to achieve project goals because it allowed BOEM to leverage pre-existing citizen efforts better than other available mechanisms.  Specifically, recreational SCUBA diving groups had already formed with an express interest in mapping and documenting WWII Battle of the Atlantic shipwrecks.

Aquatic Insect Monitoring in Grand Canyon,"Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program","Organic Act of 1879, The Grand Canyon Protection Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-575)","The goal of this project is monitoring the Colorado River ecosystem and its response to flow management from dams, particularly Glen Canyon Dam. Aquatic insects are the cornerstone of food webs in and around rivers. Quantifying the abundance and diversity of aquatic insects over time and space is important to understanding the health of river ecosystems and how rivers are affected by dam management policies. This dataset is based on simple light traps set at the river’s edge every evening by river rafters. Currently, the dataset contains over 10,000 samples of adult aquatic insects and several million individual insects. This citizen science effort allows us to ask and answer questions about the Colorado River that are truly unprecedented in scale, such as how hydropower releases from Glen Canyon Dam affect aquatic insect populations and the health of river food webs, how the phenology (seasonal timing) of aquatic insects varies by species and with distance downstream from the Dam, and how aquatic insect populations vary from year-to-year throughout the entire Grand Canyon.","Citizen Science has been essential and critical to the success of this project. Sampling aquatic insects on a large scale over long periods of time is impossible for typical research groups of only a few people. However, sampling aquatic insects on a large scale, over long periods of time, can be achieved by working cooperatively with people who are on the river every day, like professional river guides and private boaters. Because of this citizen science collaboration, USGS researchers have been able to collect samples of aquatic insects across the entire Colorado River Basin throughout the entire year.","The project started in April 2012, and is ongoing.","This project takes place in the Colorado River Basin in Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico.","The project targets anyone river rafting on the Colorado River. Over 250 people have participated in the project since it was started in 2012, and the average number of active participants per day is around 5 people collecting light trap samples. The number of volunteer hours is around 10,000. Although some participants are truly unpaid volunteers, USGS does offer a modest stipend for each sample provided and most participants chose to accept the stipend.",All participants provided formal consent. USGS advertised the opportunity through rafting publications and public lectures and then participants contact the agency if they were interested in helping.,"Light trap samples of emergent aquatic insects are the primary submission of participants. Participants are provided with a simple light trap that they deploy each night during their rafting trip. After one hour, the light trap is turned off, the sample is put in an individual bottle, and at the conclusion of the river trip bottles are returned to the USGS Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center for laboratory processing. Since 2012, over 10,000 light trap samples have been collected by citizen scientists.","Funding for this project in FY17 was provided by the Bureau of Reclamation’s Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program ($200,000) and the Department of Energy’s Western Area Power Administration ($50,000). In FY18, funding was provided by the Bureau of Reclamation ($200,000) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ($75,000, via a FWS and USGS Strategic Science Partnership Award). For both years, around $15,000 was given to citizen science participants as a stipend for collecting samples while the remainder of project funding went towards covering salaries of approximately 3 FTEs each year. FTEs coordinated collection of samples, performed laboratory processing of samples, and conducted the analysis, interpretation, and writing up the data.","Federal partners include the U.S. Geological Survey scientists funded by USBR and the Department of Energy - Western Area Power Administration, which provided funding in FY17 for work in the Upper Colorado Basin in Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming. In FY18, the Fish and Wildlife Service provided funding for work in the Upper Colorado Basin through a Strategic Science Partnership award.

Non-Federal partners included Grand Canyon River Guides, which helped facilitate this project by connecting USGS scientists with citizen scientist river guides.","The mission of the USGS Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center is providing science in support of adaptive management experimentation at Glen Canyon Dam. This project has fundamentally advanced this mission by identifying links between flow management policies and the health of river food webs, including native endangered fish and highly valued sport fish like rainbow trout.","This project led to a change in flow management policies at Glen Canyon Dam starting in 2018.  Specifically, during times when hydropower demands were lowest, flow releases were adjusted to try to enhance aquatic insect abundance and diversity. These Bug Flows were tested at Glen Canyon Dam from May to August 2018 and news of the flow experiment was widely reported in mass media including the New York Times, Washington Post, and US News & World Report (https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/arizona/articles/2018-04-30/low-steady-flows-from-arizona-dam-could-benefit-bugs).",These data report the abundance and diversity of aquatic insects captured in each of the individual light trap samples.

Non-Federal partners include Portland State University, Washington State University Vancouver, Friends of Fort Vancouver National Historic Site, Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, Vancouver Parks and Recreation, Bike Clark County, and Clark College.","The project serves to further the NPS mission to share information on NPS resources and to conduct scientific outreach to children and adults. The project fosters relationships with conservation partners tied to science and education, provides interpretative programs to improve public access to archaeological sites, and builds new dialog with community members through citizen science. Visitors to the site are encouraged to interact with the citizen scientists who had been trained in modern interpretation and communication skills by NPS staff. Formal tours of the site associated with the project were held with youth from the Fur to Fossil Summer Camp (Oregon Museum of Science and Industry), Bike Skills 101 (Vancouver Parks and Recreation and Bike Clark County), and the Clark College STEM Camp (Clark College). Citizen Scientists share their knowledge with children at the Kids Dig program funded by the Friends of Fort Vancouver National Historic Site.","The citizen scientists collected data from a highly significant archaeological site and interpreted the archaeological program to the public. The student graduate research assistant coordinated and managed citizen scientists in the Fort Vancouver Archaeological Laboratory, assisted and mentored by NPS archaeologists. Multiple collections were cleaned and analyzed and were incorporated into technical reports supporting the adaptive reuse of historical structures and infrastructure upgrades to the East Vancouver Barracks. Results were shared at the 2018 Archaeology Roadshow, a public archaeology event hosted by Portland State University. Data continue to be used in site planning at the Vancouver Barracks.","Data collected from the archaeological site are protected under two Federal laws, the Archeological Resources Protection Act and the National Historic Preservation Act, to prevent looting or other disturbance of sensitive archaeological resources. Professional archaeologists and student researchers affiliated with an accredited University with a mentoring professional archaeologist may be given access to the data for research purposes. Those interested in the results may contact the park cultural resources branch."
Biodiversity Discovery and Phenology in Acadia National Park,NPS,National Park Service Organic Act,"Biodiversity discovery and phenology in Acadia National Park engages the public in recording observations of plants and animals in Acadia. Volunteers can participate through a variety of methods, including by participating in targeted bioblitzes such as an intertidal blitz or moth blitz, by attending ranger-led or Schoodic Institute-led programs such as Sea Watch or Hawk Watch, or by submitting observations on their own through iNaturalist, eBird, or Nature’s Notebook. In each of these methods, volunteers follow standardized procedures for recording observations of plants and animals. Observations are often accompanied by photographs, and all observations are subject to quality control and data management after submission. The goal of the project is to document biodiversity and phenology in Acadia National Park to: (1) improve understanding of park resources; (2) inform decisions regarding the management of park resources; and (3) provide educational and inspirational experiences for park visitors. These project goals derive from the mission of the National Park Service.","Citizen science is particularly appropriate for documenting biodiversity and phenology for a number of reasons. Park managers require information on a large number of species and from a large number of locations—more than park staff or cooperating professional scientists can observe on their own. Furthermore, engaging volunteers in the documentation of biodiversity and phenology, especially with additional communication through interpretation, education, or other means, can help participants learn about natural resources and good stewardship. Studies have established that volunteers with little training can readily document biodiversity and phenology, supporting the use of citizen science for this project.",The project started in June 2004 and is ongoing.,"The project is located in Acadia National Park, Maine.","The project targeted park visitors and local residents. The total number of individuals involved during this period was approximately 10,000, and the average number of active participants per year was about 5,000. However, participation is seasonal, and most participation occurs during the fall.","All participants provided consent through user agreements and other mechanisms associated with data collection tools (e.g., iNaturalist, eBird, Nature’s Notebook) and signed Volunteer agreements.",The project received observations on species occurrence and information on timing of seasonal life cycle events.,"There is no dedicated budget for biodiversity discovery and phenology in Acadia National Park. Funding, staff time, and supplies came from a variety of Federal and private sources. In FY17 and FY18, NPS contributed a total of $44,000 ($37,000 in FY17 from Acadia accounts, $7,000 in FY18 from non-Acadia accounts) through Task Agreements to Schoodic Institute. These task agreements supported personnel, methods refinement, training workshops for participants, data management, and communication. NPS contributed staff time and supplies through the Resource Management Division and the Interpretation and Education Division of Acadia National Park, mainly staff and supplies associated with the Research Learning Center in Acadia. Agency full-time equivalents (FTEs) were used to help coordinate the project and run some biodiversity discovery interpretive programs, and 0.5 FTEs supported the project in FY17 and FY18. Schoodic Institute led the implementation of the project and provided additional support for the project through its own funding, staff time, and supplies.",Non-Federal partners included Schoodic Institute.,"The project directly supports three major components of the NPS mission by: (1) using the data to inform the management and preservation of natural resources; (2) helping volunteers enjoy, learn, and become inspired about the natural resources in Acadia National Park; and (3) cooperating with partners to extend the benefits of conservation throughout the country, especially when volunteers continue to make observations and otherwise contribute to science, stewardship, and education when they go home.","NPS, Schoodic Institute, and partner scientists and educators use the data generated by this project to understand what species occur in Acadia National Park and when they exhibit different phenological behaviors (e.g., migration, flowering, and fruiting). This information helps to manage natural resources by identifying invasive and vulnerable species, informing restoration projects and assessing their success, and timing fieldwork. Additionally, NPS and Schoodic Institute staff communicate the results to participants and to the public, providing valuable educational experiences. Project results are all important to advancing the NPS mission in Acadia National Park.","Data from this project can be found in free public databases managed by iNaturalist, eBird, USA National Phenology Network, and Hawk Count (Hawk Migration Association of North America). In each of those databases, users can search for data from Acadia National Park; in iNaturalist, users can additionally find data under the project Downeast and Acadia. There are smaller amounts of data managed by individual researchers who are involved in the project. Those data will be shared at the completion of their projects, if not sooner, in accordance with the conditions of the researchers’ permits."
Dragonfly Mercury Project: Engaging Citizens with Resource Conservation,NPS,NPS Organic Act (54 U.S.C. 100101(1916)),"Mercury, a toxic pollutant that can harm human and wildlife health, often enters parks as air pollution from distant, human-caused sources, such as coal-burning power plants, and can enter the food web and build up in top predators. The Dragonfly Mercury Project (DMP) is a dynamic national scale program to understand mercury pollution risks to protected areas. Developed in collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the University of Maine (UMaine), and the National Park Service, and implemented at more than 100 national parks across the country, the DMP engages citizen scientists as key participants in data collection of dragonfly larvae, which serve as indicators of mercury in aquatic food webs. Activities include hiking and sampling a national park waterbody, donning waders and using  a net to collect dragonfly larvae from the water’s bottom, using approved methods to sort and identify samples, preserving specimens, and filling out a field data sheet. This research helps the NPS better manage risk and protect resources and park visitors from the ill effects of mercury. The DMP was initiated with three main objectves: (1) increase understanding of mercury contamination in national parks across the United States using dragonfly larvae as biosentinels; (2) engage and educate citizen scientists in the collection of scientific data to increase their understanding of field ecology, wetland ecosystems, data literacy, conservation, and the impacts of air pollution; and (3) inform NPS policy and management decisions, such as determining when and where to provide warnings on fish consumption, identifying areas where mercury contamination may be harming wildlife, and identifying sites where mercury remediation may be appropriate. Entering its ninth field season in 2019, the DMP seeks to expand its impact by increasing data relevancy, enhancing the experience of the public participants, expanding partnerships, and informing sound resource management decisions.","The DMP is conducted via an Interagency Agreement with the U.S. Geological Survey. The scope and broad geographic coverage of this sampling is only possible because of public participation. Participation enables the NPS to foster teachable moments on the management of air, water, and biological resources and connect people to parks using parks as outdoor classrooms and living laboratories. This is a highly cost-effective study that leverages citizen participation to implement a national scale assessment of mercury bioaccumulation in biosentinel organisms across multiple national parks. The full cost of a study of this magnitude that relied solely upon USGS or UMaine technical staff to conduct all aspects of data collection would exceed $1.5 million in technician salary, lab analyses, and travel costs. Additionally, this project benefits from substantial in-kind contributions by the principal investigator’s team. Citizen scientists gain new perspectives and practice civic skills, while project scientists gain additional data and insights on mercury in the food web.","The project started in May 2011 at four pilot parks in the eastern United States: Acadia National Park, Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historic Park, Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site, and Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The DMP is ongoing.","Participation in the project is possible throughout the United States. All seven NPS Regions, 30 of 32 Inventory & Monitoring Networks, and National Parks in 43 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have participated.","The project targeted high school students, interns and youth groups, and local community groups. More than 4,000 citizen scientists have engaged in the DMP since the project’s inception in 2011. Approximately 600 citizen scientists engaged in FY17, and current reports estimate at least 700 participants in FY18. The average number of active participants per month (May–September) was approximately 200. More than 10,000 volunteer hours have been dedicated to the DMP since 2011. FY17 recorded 3,755 volunteer hours, and current reports estimate at least 4,160 volunteer hours in FY18.",All participants consented.,"Over the course of FY17 and FY18, participants submitted about 4,270 dragonfly larvae samples for mercury analysis, 300 field data forms, and 30 observations on iNaturalist for an approximate total of 4,600 submissions.","Funding for the Dragonfly Mercury Project has been varied and adaptively implemented. The Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station and faculty research funds from the UMaine provided initial support for the project in 2011. Funding responsibilities then shifted to the National Park Service, followed by the USGS/NPS Water Quality Partnership from FY14 to FY16. In-kind contributions from the USGS Environmental Health Mission Area Contaminant Biology Program, UMaine, and the NPS provided additional support during these years. Since FY16, the DMP has been distinctly funded through a combination of park discretionary funds (i.e., parks, regions, networks), other NPS funds (WASO), and non-NPS funds (i.e., in-kind contributions from USGS, NPS, UMaine, and citizen scientists). Funding for FY17 totaled $204,319, and funding for FY18 totaled $353,700. Park funds contributed to 54% of the total NPS funding, while other NPS funds covered the remaining 46%. A total of $558,019 of direct in-kind contributions was obtained over two years, and an estimated $827,381 in matching support (148% of budget, 60% of total project costs) was secured over that same time. This project is heavily leveraged by matching support in the form of NPS staff time and field gear; citizen scientist time; USGS reduced analytical costs, principal investigator (PI) salary, data management, quality assurance; UMaine reduced indirect, graduate student and research support, and project communication. Matching in-kind support included $397,000 (29% of project total) from park staff, $158,300 (11% of project total) from citizen science, $26,250 (2% of project total) from sampling supplies provided by parks, $164,215 (12% of project total) from USGS, and $81,616 (6% of project total) from UMaine. The FY17 and FY18 budgets covered project oversight by USGS and UMaine, PI salaries and a project coordinator, staff training, lab analysis, supplies, data management, reporting, and travel to a DMP core team meeting. FY18 funds also supported affiliated research endeavors. FY17 support was provided by 2.6 full-time equivalents (FTEs), including NPS staff support at 56 parks, five regions, and one NPS Air Resources Division DMP project coordinator. FY18 support was provided by 3.0 FTE, including NPS staff support at 64 parks, five regions, and one NPS Air Resources Divsion DMP project coordinator. Citizen scientists contributed an additional 1.8 and 2.0 FTEs, respectively.","Federal partners included U.S. Geological Survey. Non-Federal partners included the University of Maine, Dartmouth College, and University of Wisconsin-LaCrosse.","The NPS preserves the natural and cultural resources and values of the national parks for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of current and future generations. Mercury (Hg) is a globally distributed, toxic contaminant that threatens resources the NPS is charged with protecting. The DMP aligns with this NPS mission by advancing scientific understanding of the spatial distribution of Hg contamination in the national parks and creating next generation stewards, enlightening a mainly youth-based pool of citizen scientists about the connection among all living things, the influence humans have upon natural systems, and how environmentally-responsible decisions can protect our parks and the planet. Beyond increasing the understanding of Hg risk across the national parks and informing policy and management decisions, the DMP fosters a deepened engagement with citizen scientists and educators, ultimately advancing an appreciation of national parks and the diversity of resources they contain for thousands of youth across America.","Three conclusions can be drawn from study Results: (1) dragonfly larvae are widespread and effective bioindicators of ecosystem risk to Hg; (2) the risk from Hg varies widely across the landscape, influenced by a combination of Hg emissions and deposition, landscape processes that control the entry of mercury into aquatic food webs, and food web structure; and (3) concentrations vary as widely within parks as across parks. Data from the DMP are used by researchers, resource managers, and classrooms and interns to further knowledge of mercury distribution, understand the vulnerability of waterbodies to mercury accumulation in foodwebs, protect resources and park visitors from the ill effects of mercury; and advance environmental literacy on local, regional, and national scales. Annual project-based outcomes include dragonfly larvae sample analysis and subsequent data results, data flyers that interpret results for each individual participating park, a technical report, and a DMP webinar. Core findings have been summarized in numerous national and international presentations at scientific meetings, a USGS fact sheet, a project report, and several pending journal articles. Given the project’s wide geographic scope, the resultant data provide a nationwide snapshot of mercury in biota, primarily from undeveloped watersheds. Since the larvae are important prey for fish, and thus can be used as a surrogate for mercury levels in fish, the data can be used to eventually inform the NPS about park- and site-specific threats from mercury to human and wildlife health. Results also provide the foundation for a DMP steering committee, transitioning this NPS-centric project to a more influential, multi-agency program that carries the endeavor into the future.","Data flyers and park data files, organized by park and year, are available only to internal DOI partners. These data are still provisional and are currently undergoing the final review and approval process. The full data release will occur with impending publications and made publicly available. The Dragonfly Mercury Project Data Web Map, a dynamic tool for accessing and visualizing data on mercury in dragonfly larvae, is available to the public at: https://www.nps.gov/articles/dragonflymercury-map.htm.

Glacier National Park Common Loon Citizen Science,NPS,National Park Service Organic Act,"The Common Loon (Gavia immer) is considered a “Species of Special Concern” by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks due to the species’ sensitivity to disturbance during nesting season and its low reproductive and recruitment rates. A volunteer-based annual loon survey began in 1988, which indicated that Glacier National Park (GNP) hosts 20% of the state’s loon population and that reproductive rates were low (five chicks per year). The citizen science pilot program started in 2005, the first in Glacier and one of the first in any national park, to increase monitoring of this sensitive species. In 2006, Glacier National Park established the Common Loon Citizen Science project to train volunteers and GNP staff to gather baseline data on population and distribution of common loons, to improve accuracy during an annual Loon Day count, and to increase survey coverage of lakes with loons. The program has established significant baseline data on loon population status, nesting areas, chick hatch and migration dates, and areas of concern for human disturbance, and the goal is to continue this long-term record to provide management recommendations about issues that may affect loon nesting success and habitat, an indicator of lake ecosystem health.","Long-term monitoring of Common Loons provides a vital insight into the health of freshwater lake ecosystems. Glacier has 45 freshwater lakes across its 1.1 million acres with the potential to support breeding Common Loons. Capacity within current staffing budgets and funding for grants or cooperative agreements for this kind of large-scale monitoring over a long-time period is not available. Prior to the establishment of the project, staff and a small number of untrained volunteers were conducting one annual Loon Day count at each lake to provide information about where loons were located in the park. That information was insufficient for making management decisions about long-term loon conservation. In 2006, Glacier National Park established the Common Loon Citizen Science project to obtain information about nest locations, nesting success, and chick survival rates, which are vital to conservation of the species, using trained volunteers who collect data at lakes more frequently. Common Loons are a good fit for citizen science engagement because they are a highly visible and charismatic species that are of interest to park visitors and the local community.",The project started in May 2005 and is ongoing.,"The program is based in Glacier National Park, Montana.","The project targeted park visitors, local community members, service groups, and students. Participants totaled 117 in 2017 and 140 in 2018, and the average number of active participants per month between June and August was approximimately 50. The total number of volunteer hours equaled 2,192 hours in 2017 and 2,797 hours in 2018.",All participants provide formal consent to participate.,Participants submit observational data and images. A total of 178 submissions were received in 2017 and 233 were received in 2018.,"Agency funding for FY17 totaled $2,000, supplemented by a $12,000 private donation from the Glacier National Park Conservancy. Recreational Fee Program Personal Services amounted to $15,000. Agency funding for FY18 totaled $2,500, supplemented by a $12,000 private donation from the Glacier National Park Conservancy. Recreational Fee Program Personal Services amounted to $18,000. Resources in both years were used for rental vehicles, fuel, backcountry per diem, field equipment, and supplies. A total of 0.7 full-time equivalents (FTEs), split between a GS-4 Project Coordinator and a GS-7 Program manager, supported the project in FY17 and FY18.","Federal partners include the Common Loon Working Group, whose members include the US Forest Service, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. Non-Federal partners include Glacier National Park Conservancy, Montana State Fish, Wildlife and Parks, and Blackfeet Tribal Community College. The Montana Department of Natural Resources, Weyerhaeuser Timber Company, and the Montana Loon Society also participate in the Common Loon Working Group.","The project advances the NPS’s mission to conserve wildlife and natural resources, in this case by engaging the public directly in collecting population data. Conservation of Common Loon populations in an unimpaired state ensures that they are available for the enjoyment of future generations. The project also fosters enjoyment of wildlife and natural resources by participants.","The data gathered by this project have been used as an indicator of the health of freshwater lake ecosystems. They have also been used to inform management decisions, such as trail locations and fishing access planning through the compliance process. Knowledge of loon nesting sites and success rates has informed planning for conservation of other species that also use freshwater lake habitats. The data have also informed a broader understanding of loon population status, breeding success, and migration timing across the state of Montana and on the adjacent Blackfeet Reservation.",Metadata for all data collected for the project are published in the National Park service Integrated Resource Management Applications (IRMA) data portal: https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2194764.

Did You Feel It? (DYFI),U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)," Organic Act of 1879, The National Earthquake Hazards and Reduction Program (NEHRP), 42 U.S.C § 7701","The Did You Feel It? (DYFI) project is designed to gather information available about earthquakes from the people who experience them. By tapping an immense number of users online, DYFI can get a detailed characterization of what people were experiencing during the earthquake, the impacts of the earthquake, and the amount of damage it caused, beyond the scope of traditional information gathering techniques. Data input from users is immediately available on the website, and its interactive platform encourages users to gain a deeper understanding of earth sciences while they participate. The DYFI data are used to inform earthquake response and scientific studies about earthquake shaking and damage.","The DYFI project taps into a natural crowdsourcing and citizen science (CCS) audience to report the shaking experienced at their location immediately after felt earthquakes. It is one of the most suitable and cost effective uses of CCS, since participants are eager to share their observations with the Federal Government, and USGS seismologists and scientists benefit from these citizen science data.","The project started in 1999 in California and then expanded in 2003 for the rest of U.S. and the world, and is still ongoing.","The project takes place internationally, particularly in locations where earthquakes occur.","The project targets populations affected by an earthquake. The total number of individuals involved is over 4.5 million since 1999, and approximately 650,000 in the 2017 to 2018 reporting period.

There were approximately 650,000 submissions in the 2017 to 2018 reporting period.","The DYFI project is extremely cost-effective. Total operations including web support, software design and upkeep, as well as user support for data requests and outreach amounts to less than one 1 FTE, since data are automatically processed.",DYFI is a USGS project and does not have any federal or non-federal partnerships associated with this project.,"The DYFI project is one of the USGS’s premiere citizen science projects. It is one of the first, most well-known, and well subscribed in the U.S. Government. DYFI takes advantage of the unique opportunity to help and learn from citizens, often by the tens of thousands, immediately after they experience shaking during an earthquake. Both the government and the population benefit from this collaborative relationship. DYFI is also a very cost-effective use of government resources, since three orders of magnitude more macroseismic data are collected in the U.S. as a result of this program, with many fewer personnel than were needed in the past.","The scientific uses of DYFI data have been documented in several scientific publications and scores of scientific peer-reviewed papers use the DYFI data (see https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032440 and https://earthquake.usgs.gov/static/lfs/data/pager/AtkinsonWaldDYFI.pdf). Hundreds of abstracts and meeting presentations employ DYFI data as well.

iCoast - Did the Coast Change?,"USGS, St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center", Organic Act of 1879; National Climate Program Act of 1978; Coastal Zone Management Act of 1976,"The value of iCoast is two-fold: (1) iCoast serves as a communication tool to explain to a broad audience what processes change the coast during major storms, and (2) the oblique imagery data sets contain the information necessary for storm impact model verification. Classification of large volumes of photographs covering a wide area is impractical without employing citizen scientists. iCoast successfully engaged the general public to assist in the classification of coastal oblique aerial imagery collected after Hurricane Sandy made landfall in November 2012. Users were able to match and classify nearly all the images along the coast. The work done by users in classifying the imagery collected after Hurricane Sandy has helped USGS scientists understand the impact of the storm. iCoast users correctly identified mainland and narrow barrier islands along the coast with a high degree of confidence. Our analysis also showed that users could reliably identify all four coastal processes, namely beach erosion, dune erosion, overwash, and inundation. Classifications generated from iCoast users are being used to test the predictive models of storm impacts along the coast by identifying differing levels of geomorphic impacts (e.g., collision, overwash, inundation) along undeveloped and developed coasts and damage to infrastructure caused by a storm.","iCoast is a cost effective way to classify large volumes of photographs covering a wide area, which was previously impractical due to the number of hours that it would have required for a staff scientist to complete the task. iCoast was developed by the USGS using citizen science and user experience expertise already available to the USGS St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center. The iCoast interface was designed using human-centered design techniques and by conducting usability testing with USGS scientists and existing iCoast users to ensure iCoast was user-friendly.","The project started in June 2014 to classify images from Hurricane Sandy. This is still an ongoing project, collecting input from users, mostly with regard to Hurricane Joaquin.","The project takes place on online but focuses on imagery collected along the U.S. east coast in areas affected by Hurricane Sandy (Cape Lookout, North Carolina to Montauk Point, New York) and Hurricane Joaquin (South Carolina/North Carolina border to Montauk Point, New York). Since this is an online project, volunteers can be from anywhere around the world that have access to the internet.","The project targets citizen scientists interested in contributing to the understanding of coastal processes and people interested in learning the impacts of Hurricane Sandy, Hurricane Joaquin, and other extreme storms. Of the 1,630 total users, 1,020 have completed at least one classification in iCoast (i.e., 62% of the people who signed on to iCoast have contributed to the collected data). When iCoast was first released, participation was higher than current numbers. All of the Hurricane Sandy images were classified by October 2015 (1 year and 4 months). Hurricane Joaquin is also 100% classified. The total number of volunteer hours was over 2,867 hours since June 2014, where it takes approximately two and a half minutes per classification.","All participants had to login and register with iCoast, therefore all participants consented to participate in iCoast.","iCoast users are asked to check for spatial correspondence between image pairs from before and after Hurricane Sandy or Hurricane Joaquin (image matching) and then users are presented with a set of specific tasks to classify the pre-event scene, detect changes, and interpret the process or processes responsible for the changes to the coast. Approximately 69,000 classifications of image pairs have been submitted, although it should be noted that an image pair can have more than one classification by multiple users.","iCoast is monitored for input from users and to be certain that it is continuing to function. A database programmer is utilized if there is a problem with the functionality of the website. A researcher is available to address any images flagged by users as unusable. iCoast is very low maintenance and functions without daily input from researchers. Other than maintenance work, no funding was provided for iCoast. There is less than 0.4 FTE annually because the project does not require a lot of attention.",No federal or non-federal partnerships associated with this project.,"The information iCoast provides allows researchers to focus on derived information contained in the oblique aerial imagery that is collected after a storm. Analysis of user input shows that iCoast users can provide valid information, which can then be used by researchers to increase understanding of coastal storm response. The USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program is actively engaged in research to further understand storm events and to develop models to predict coastal change hazards. iCoast was developed to further inform coastal change hazards research as well as raise awareness to the public about how extreme storms affect US coastlines. More information about the purpose of iCoast, can be found at https://coastal.er.usgs.gov/icoast/about.php.","The Storm-Induced Coastal Change Hazards component of the of the National Assessment of Coastal Change Hazards project focuses on understanding the magnitude and variability of extreme storm impacts on sandy beaches. The overall objective is to improve real-time and scenario-based predictions of coastal change to support management of coastal infrastructure, resources, and safety (https://coastal.er.usgs.gov/hurricanes/overview.php). Classifications generated from iCoast users are being used to test and validate the predictive models of storm impacts along the coast by identifying differing levels of geomorphic impacts (e.g., collision, overwash, and inundation).

Within the Ecosystems Mission Area, the Status and Trends Program – which funds the USA-NPN – provides (1) science, technology, and information that resource managers use to understand the current conditions and status of plants, animals, and habitats under management responsibility of Interior bureaus and other Federal, State, and Tribal partners, and (2) collects, analyzes, and delivers data and information about past and potential future changes to species and habitats.","Nature’s Notebook data for the USA-NPN are used by university or government scientists for research on topics ranging from understanding, detecting, and controlling plant invasions; predicting effects of frost on tree fruit crops; documenting drought impacts on corn and soybean production; and validating satellite-based assessments of foliage coloration in the autumn. About 60 peer-reviewed articles have been published in high-quality ecological journals. All information products with USGS authors are compliant with “Fundamental Science Practice” review, approval, and release standards established by the Office of Science Quality and Integrity. Data are also used by Federal, Municipal, and Tribal natural resource managers for field-based decision-making. For example, managers have used the data to plan restoration of degraded habitats in flood-plains, to map invasive plant species to support detection and control activities, to prioritize habitat for migratory animals such as birds and monarch butterflies, to understand patterns of tree pollen production as a hazard to human health, and to plan street-sweeping activities designed to improve water quality in local municipalities.","The USA-NPN National Coordinating Office freely and readily delivers observational data on plant and animal phenology collected through Nature’s Notebook in several formats, including minimally processed status and intensity datasets as well as derived phenometrics for individual plants, sites, and regions.

The National Map Corps (TNMCorps),USGS,Organic Act of 1879,"The National Map Corps (TNMCorps) is a crowdsourcing program that is part of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Geospatial Program’s The National Map, which collaboratively improves and delivers topographic information for the Nation. The National Map is free to the public and the government, and its uses range from disaster planning and emergency response to scientific analysis and recreation. The use of The National Map Corps, which encourages citizen participation in volunteer map data collection activities, will result in more complete, current, and accurate national datasets for The National Map.","The USGS National Geospatial Program (NGP) is currently pursuing a two-pronged approach for acquiring and maintaining structures data (e.g., data on schools, hospitals, post offices, fire stations, cemeteries, and other important public buildings). Where available the Program is seeking authoritative national sources. To fill the gaps and improve the completeness, currency, and accuracy of the structures data, NGP’s strategy is to deploy The National Map Corps (TNMCorps) in using new technologies and Internet services to enable members of the public to produce volunteered geographic information (VGI) that will update and enhance the datasets.
The volunteer effort of TNMCorps to collect and improve structures data provides many benefits to the Program, its users, and the Nation. Volunteer participation improves government efficiency, public access to data, and data quality. Participation in The National Map Corps is easy and completely voluntary and raises geographic awareness and improves users’ skills in using web-based tools. Developing more complete and current structures data in The National Map may improve emergency preparedness and response. Furthermore, The National Map Corps benefits the agency and the participants by providing opportunities for citizen participation in USGS science as well as creating opportunities for collaboration with other Federal agencies and partners.","The project started in March of 2012, and is ongoing.","The project encompasses the entire United States, as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The project takes place online, so all volunteers with internet access can contribute.","The project targets the general public.

Building Capacity to Measure Air Pollution Mitigation Strategies at Schools,EPA,Clean Water Act (Section 103),"Studies have shown that populations spending time near busy roads face elevated risks for many adverse health outcomes including asthma, developmental effects, and premature mortality. Research indicates that noise and vegetative barriers (separately or in combination) can reduce downwind air pollutant concentrations near busy roads. In 2016, EPA funded an intramural study on the effectiveness of roadside vegetation barriers to reduce exposure to vehicle emissions at sites in Oakland and Detroit. One of those locations, Brookfield Elementary School in Oakland, CA, is directly adjacent to a busy goods movement corridor (I-880). EPA assisted in the design of a vegetation barrier that was planted next to an existing noise barrier for air pollution mitigation. EPA also took initial air samples to establish baseline air quality conditions on the school site. Subsequent funding awarded in FY18 supplemented and expanded this work by: (1) acquiring low-cost sensors and designing innovative sensor housing units so that school/community members can monitor the effectiveness of the vegetation barrier as it grows over time; (2) training sensor operators and teachers on how to collect and evaluate sampled data; and (3) developing educational materials for Brookfield Elementary. While the focus of this project is to evaluate the progress and effectiveness of the vegetative barrier, the methods and resources can also be used to promote and evaluate the implementation of other mitigation strategies to improve air quality at schools based on the recently released EPA report “Best Practices for Reducing Near-Road Air Pollution at Schools.”","The initial phase of this project provided expert technical guidance to the School and the project partners on how best to design a vegetative barrier to mitigate near-road air pollution exposures. Guidelines were developed and applied for how to plant an effective barrier. Many juvenile trees and shrubs have been planted; however, it will take a few years before it will be possible to measure an air quality signal related to the barrier using sensors. In the meantime, resources have been devoted to the design and production of two user-friendly sensor packages; a Solar-Powered Air Quality Sampling System and a Portable Air Quality Sampler System. In May 2018, hands-on training of the equipment was piloted with school staff, though no data were collected. The long-term nature of this project is well-suited to citizen science since the vegetation barrier will need to mature and EPA staff cannot be on hand to regularly collect research data from year to year. Instead, the EPA is investing in building the capacity for the school and its staff to be able to measure air quality on their campus in the future.",The project is ongoing.,"The project is located in Oakland, CA.",The project targeted students and staff of Brookfield Elementary School with possible broader community involvement in the future.,N/A,N/A,"Funding amounting to $40,000 in FY17 and $38,000 in FY18 was used for contractor support, air sensor acquisition, and development of training materials.

Crowdsourcing to Monitor Private Wells and Assess Contaminant Sources,EPA,N/A,"The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to use crowdsourcing to provide improved data to assess water quality in private water wells to protect private domestic well users. Private domestic wells (PDWs) are a source of drinking water for 15 percent of the U.S. population. Because private wells are an important drinking water source, it is incumbent upon homeowners to (1) understand potential sources of well contamination; (2) conduct testing of the appropriate parameters that may affect their well; and (3) take action on the results. This project addresses these steps, focusing on key parameters important to the water quality of private wells, including nitrate and E. coli. Nitrate is the most common anthropogenic contaminant found in private water wells that exceed human health standards. Assessing nitrate concentrations in private drinking water wells is especially critical in homes with young children (e.g., preparing infant formula using nitrate contaminated water is a known risk factor for methemoglobinemia or blue baby syndrome). E. coli, another parameter of key concern in private water wells, can emanate from human and animal fecal wastes. Wells can be contaminated from the surface where the wells are not adequately sealed or through the subsurface via contaminated ground water. In a national study of U.S. aquifers, nearly 30% of over 1100 private wells sampled tested positive for fecal-indicator bacteria.","Monitoring of private drinking water wells is ideally suited to crowdsourcing and citizen science. This project is being developed as a pilot to develop the training materials needed to conduct sampling, and how to understand the impacts of contamination in domestic wells and potential solutions. It is anticipated after this pilot work is completed that high school STEM classes nationally could independently carry out these efforts to protect this water supply.",The project started in 2018 and is ongoing.,"Initially, the project took place in Arkansas high schools and is expanding to other schools.",The project targets high school STEM classes.

The project requires less than one FTE per fiscal year.",Non-Federal partners included high school STEM classes.,"This project will provide a better understanding of the extent of the fate and transport of key groundwater pollutants, temporally and spatially. It can provide important information to protect a key component of the U.S. domestic water supply.","Data gathered will advance understanding of the quality of water in private domestic wells, to help ensure the safety of these water supplies.",These data will be made available to the public as confirmed by the owners of the wells.
Cyanoscope: EPA collaborative partnership on monitoring harmful algal blooms,EPA,N/A,"This program started at the request of the New England State environmental agencies and their efforts to determine how best to monitor and manage harmful algal and cyanobacteria blooms. This initial project evolved into a three-tiered program to educate people on the problem, how to monitor and provide surveillance to better understand the dynamics of harmful algal blooms (HABs), and the collection of key data to assist in determining trends, hotspots, and other important data surrounding HABs.","Crowdsourcing and citizen science is the most cost-effective way to collect data on HABs. HABs can be very transitory in nature, and having a large collaborative of individuals from all geographic areas provides much better coverage and monitoring/surveillance opportunities.

HiveScience: A Citizen Science Project for Beekeepers,EPA,N/A,"HiveScience is a citizen science project designed for beekeepers that promotes EPA public engagement around collecting data on hive health, an important research issue at the local, national and international levels. For this project, beekeepers collect data on the health status of honey bee hives, submit a sample of honey for laboratory analysis for biomarkers of honey bee immune response, and provide data on the overwintering fate of sampled hives using an EPA-branded mobile application. Ultimately, these data will be used to determine if there is a correlation between biomarkers of honey bee colony health and actual colony overwintering performance.","The beekeeping community is acutely aware of the issues affecting honey bee colony health and is motivated to find solutions. Recognizing the limited capacity of State and Federal agencies to monitor and sample a sufficiently large sample of honey bee colonies, partnering with beekeepers is really the only viable solution. The network of engaged citizen scientists established through this project will increase the likelihood of identifying cost-effective tools capable of predicting honey bee hive health, reducing colony losses, and saving beekeepers both time and money.",The project started in February 2017 and is ongoing.,The project takes place on a National scale.,The project targeted beekeepers. The total number of individuals involved during this period was 100. The total number of volunteer hours was around 200 hours.,All participants consented to participation by actively downloading the project-specific smartphone mobile application and opting to request a honey sample kit.,"Volunteer beekeepers completed a hive health survey for one honey bee hive using an EPA-provided smartphone mobile application.

Kansas City Transportation and Local Scale Air Quality Study (KC TRAQS),EPA,N/A,"KC TRAQS crowdsourcing and citizen science (CCS) was one component of a larger project that includes fixed sites with research grade monitors, research grade mobile monitoring, and modeling. The CCS part of the project had two goals: (1) to evaluate the ability of citizen scientists to collect valid air quality data with little training in collection methods using a custom sensor package, and (2) to evaluate the ability of the AirMappers, a low cost and portable air monitoring package, to collect valid data that can be used for Federal, State, and local air monitoring needs. The project also provided an opportunity for providing educational outreach. The project was being conducted by loaning AirMappers to participants in two ways. (1) Scheduled deployments to participating groups and library checkouts were conducted by giving a presentation to area middle and high school students and the loan of five AirMappers for one week to a class. The class conducted their own experiments using the AirMappers, but were asked to keep notes and take measurements outdoors in the study area. Other groups in the study area scheduled a similar loan of the equipment, though only one group has participated. 2) AirMappers were also loaned to two libraries in the study area for check out to community members. Those who checked out the AirMappers were provided a manual and contact information for the study leads.",The only way to gather data on the effectiveness of CCS campaigns is to include citizen science in the study. The awarding of grants or other means to collect data are less effective for this type of study because the agency loses some control of the collection of data and decisions on how the study is conducted.,The project started in October 2017 and concluded in October 2018.,"The project is located in Kansas City, KS.","The project targeted middle and high school classes, community volunteers, and organized group volunteers.

The CCS part of the project investigates the ability of low-cost monitors and citizen scientists to provide quality data, which could increase the ability of all interested parties and reduce costs of collecting environmental data. It also increases public awareness of environmental effects of transportation-related sources of air pollutants on human health by encouraging public participation in data collection.","Science questions pertaining to the citizen science component of the larger KC-TRAQS project were: Can the effectiveness of a self-driven community measurement project be quantified? What is the suitability of a sensor instrument package (e.g., AirMapper) to support real-time mapping of particulate matter by citizens? What is the added value of citizen science in the research process and can this value added be quantified? The goal is to use data collected by the citizen science instrument package (i.e., AirMapper) in analyses that will also use data collected by more traditional methods (i.e., FEF/FRM instrumentation, lower-cost sensors, etc.). These results may be used to inform future citizen science projects (i.e., lessons learned) and also increase community environmental awareness.","All data from the KC TRAQS project will be made available to the public.

Micro CSI-Urban Edition: A Microbial Citizen Science Initiative in Urban Watersheds,EPA,Clean Water Act,"Across the Nation, a number of citizen science efforts have been conducted to monitor water quality. Efforts have included monitoring of bacteriological parameters (E. coli, enterococci, and fecal coliforms) and/or physicochemical parameters (e.g., temperature, turbidity, pH, conductivity). Although these efforts are extremely useful to identify a problem area, they can be limited in scope due to insufficient resource availability, human manpower, or even sampling logistics. Likewise, monitoring efforts conducted by county, city, and State governments to identify water quality issues are often limited due to funding and/or lack of available personnel. The aim of our proposal is to build Urban MicroCSI, a program bringing together the efforts of citizen scientists from a variety of urban locations. Information gathered by citizen scientists on microbial water quality will be collected in a central location and used to adapt a statistical modeling tool (Virtual Beach) already used in recreational beaches to urban streams. Virtual Beach will facilitate identification of stream locations prone to impairment due to fecal bacteria and the environmental conditions that produce impairments. The effort will include source identification to better inform mitigation practices.","One of the main drivers of using this type of program is to facilitate water quality monitoring efforts by citizen scientists and encourage community participation in activities promoting environmental awareness. Sampling surface waters for water quality analysis can be an expensive activity for State and local governments.  Monitoring by citizen scientists presents a cost-effective alternative, but it is imperative that the data abides to a QA/QC level acceptable under regulatory criteria. Using CCS allowed testing of the quality and usability of the data, sampling efficiency, and sampling coverage. The program provides an example of how other communities can develop similar monitoring programs using citizen scientists.",The project started in December 2016 and is complete.,"The project is located in Proctor Creek and Oconee River Watersheds in Atlanta and Athens, GA, respectively.","The project targeted volunteers from the city of Atlanta for the Proctor Creek watershed, and University of Georgia (UGA) students in Athens for the Oconee River watershed. More than 30 individuals were involved during this period, and the average number of active participants per week was three.","Volunteers collecting samples in Proctor Creek Atlanta agreed to participate under a program called Neighborhood Water Watch, a community driven collaborative program between the Chattahoochee River Keeper and local neighborhood groups. In addition, the Chattahoochee River Keeper trains volunteers on sample collection and analysis under an EPA approved QAPP.   Students from the University of Georgia agreed to perform sample collection and analysis as part of a class  integrating experiential learning in the curriculum.","The participants provided data, and shipped or delivered water samples to the EPA.","A Federal employee (1.0 FTE) designed and coordinated the overall project, managed the contract, and reviewed data for accuracy. Part of the funds ($56,000 in FY17 and $18,000 in FY18) were used to buy materials for sampling kits, materials used to quantify fecal indictors, and reagents to perform DNA extraction and analysis. Money was also used to buy a multiprobe meter to measure environmental parameters and pay volunteer coordinators in Atlanta and Athens. Other resources included efforts by a sustainability class at UGA focusing on experiential learning, which provided volunteers and data during the last sampling semester. Federal staff performed data management and reviewed data for presentation.","Non-Federal partners in Athens included the River Basin Center and Watershed UGA, both at the University of Georgia. In Atlanta, the Non-Federal partner was the Chatahoochee River Keeper.","One of EPA’s needs identified in the review of the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act is the need to provide alternative methodologies for rapid water quality assessments. The need is not only valid for coastal waters, but it is also highly needed for inland waters. The aim of this project was to develop a robust set of information suitable to test and implement the use of Virtual Beach for the rapid assessment of bacterial impairments in urban watersheds. Virtual Beach is a statistical tool developed for freshwater and marine beaches to rapidly identify fecal bacterial levels exceeding ambient water quality criteria using easy to measure environmental parameters. This project will provide information needed by the EPA to test the applicability of the model for urban watersheds. In addition, microbial source tracking information will be integrated to determine the prevalent sources of contamination impacting urban hotspots.","The results from this project will be used to increase environmental education and awareness of citizen scientists on the impact of fecal contaminants in urban streams; develop easily transferable protocols for the collection by citizen scientists of meaningful data usable for the development and testing of models; empower and encourage local NGOs to develop a consistent and sustainable sampling and analysis plan that provides a reliable source of information for the local government and fosters a healthy partnership in which citizen scientists are an essential part of the process; and finally, it will make Virtual Beach-Stream and River Module widely available to local governments, so that they can use it to better allocate resources when determining and implementing mitigation strategies.","The data collected will be available to the public in a variety of ways. The data from Proctor Creek in Atlanta has been posted in the Chattahoochee River Keeper website, under the neighborhood water watch (https://nww.chattahoochee.org/DataPage). The data collected in Athens, GA will be integrated with the monitoring performed by UGA students under the watershed UGA effort and which will reside in a variety of google documents available to students for a variety of analysis. In addition, some of the data can be found in the Upper Oconee Watershed Network site (http://uown.org/UOWN-Wordpress/monitoring-results). Finally, the data will be available to the scientific community in the form of manuscripts that are currently under preparation by both EPA and UGA."
Using Citizen Science to Analyze Underwater Videos in the Great Lakes,EPA,"Clean Water Act § 104, 33 U.S.C. § 1254","The goal of this project is to evaluate a web-based citizen science approach to analyzing underwater videos in the Great Lakes to determine substrate type and presence of invasive species, such as round gobies or dreissenid mussels. Citizen scientists will be trained and tested for accuracy using a subset of underwater videos. The relative precision, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness of the citizen science approach will be compared to expert video interpretations. In addition to increasing our understanding of habitat characteristics and invasive species in the Great Lakes, this project aims to address the following questions: Can a citizen science approach to underwater video analysis meet the information needs of managers? How does the data produced by citizen scientists compare to the data produced by experts in terms of precision, accuracy, and relevancy to management needs? What effects, if any, does video quality and attribute selection have when comparing analysis of experts and citizen scientists?","A citizen science approach to underwater video analysis provides a cost-effective means for individual videos to be analyzed by multiple viewers. Multiple analysts increase precision and reduce bias but trained professional analysts are expensive. The cost to hire a single expert to review each video is $36,000. The CCS project also offers the opportunity to analyze and share results with the public in a more timely manner than would be possible having experts analyze the videos.","A stakeholder input group was convene in Fall 2017. The project was designed in early 2018 and beta-tested in May – July 2018. Updates to the application are being made and tested, with a public launch planned for 2019. The project is ongoing.",The project is located in the Great Lakes Region of the United States.,"The project targeted public and tribal, local, State, and Federal partners with 161 participants visiting the website in the beta-testing phase.",N/A,"In the beta-testing phase, 468 images were clipped from 52 videos representing 52 sites. Each image needed to be viewed 15 different times by different people. One hundreed and fifty video clips were pulled from 28 videos representing 28 sites, and each video need to be viewed 10 times each. When reviewing a video clip, three questions were answered and when viewing a image, two questions were answered.  As a result, there were approximately 18,540 data submissions.","In FY17, EPA staff coordinated with stakeholders and designed and managed the project on the crowdsourcing website Zooniverse. A contractor provided technical support to run statistical analysis, modify videos to be used, and assist with programming. Total funding was $12,000 and required less than one FTE. In FY18, Federal staff upgraded the web-based project on the Zooniverse platform to include higher quality videos. External funding was used for video processing and contract support for the redesign and execution of the project. The FY18 budget was $25,000 and required less than one FTE.","Non-Federal partners included the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and Michigan Department of Natural Resources with a stakeholder team from 14 other non-Federal agencies. In addition, staff from different offices within EPA helped design the website","To effectively protect and restore water quality, EPA, states, and tribes need high quality data and information. Underwater videos are a tool being developed to help with assessing the overall condition of the Great Lakes as part of the National Coastal Condition Assessment, one of the surveys under the National Aquatic Resource Survey Program. The National Aquatic Resource Surveys (NARS) are collaborative programs between EPA, states, and tribes designed to assess the quality of the nation's coastal waters, lakes and reservoirs, rivers and streams, and wetlands using a statistical survey design. This work to improve our ability to process, analyze, and assess videos of underwater features and characteristics in a timely and cost-effective approach will increase the viability of using this technology as part of NARS and State/tribal water quality assessments.","Although results from the beta-test are still being evaluated, preliminary results demonstrated that citizen scientists were able to identify substrate type, round gobies, and vegetation. The team also found that the use of crowdsourcing shows promise in being an acceptable and cost-effective means of interpreting/screening videos for experts to analyze in more depth. Additionally, the team learned that the agreement between citizen scientists and expert analysis would likely improve if the quality of the video was improved. Using the finding, the FY18 effort will focus on re-evaluating the tool with higher quality videos. Finally, the team will also be working on establishing a smooth and effective workflow so that when videos collected in 2020 as part of the National Coastal Condition Assessment are submitted, they will be processed and results can be shared in a timely manner that will be useful to resource managers in the Great Lakes.",Results from the beta-test are being reviewed. The preliminary results were shared with stakeholders in August 2018. Results of the beta-test from sites where there was agreement between experts and citizen scientist will be included on the Deep Lake Explorer website and in the 2015 NCCA reports. A report will be posted for the general public and participants at https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/USEPA/deep-lake-explorer.
Using Citizen Science to Improve Drinking Water Epidemiology Studies in Puerto Rico,EPA,N/A,"The goal of this project is to showcase the simplicity of an innovative saliva test and improve the way epidemiology studies are designed using citizen science. Families with 3rd to 5th graders will report incidences of gastrointestinal disease to science teachers to facilitate follow-up stool and saliva tests in impacted school districts. The innovative saliva tests use salivary antibodies as a non-invasive indicator of waterborne infections. The project will prepare instructions for parents on how to report incidences of gastrointestinal illness that will be sent home with students at the start of the school year. The school districts in participating rural communities will collect health data when illnesses occur to maximize the effectiveness and improve the results of the epidemiology study. The incidence of illness will then be linked to specific community water systems using Safe Drinking Water Act sample results and violations. This project is important because it inspires citizens (i.e., non-experts) to actively participate in targeted studies to improve their health and understanding of water treatment. A secondary benefit will be the educational aspect for students. School science teachers will encourage students to participate, promote the scientific method behind this epidemiology study and provide information on waterborne illness, human health, and personal hygiene.","Citizens in Puerto Rico have a great interest in and can be positive contributors to environmental protection and the health of their communities. This citizen science project builds on a long history of working with citizens, community groups, students, and volunteers in rural communities in Puerto Rico. It allows community citizen scientists to become engaged in the process of linking their illnesses to pathogens in their drinking water systems. With the project-generated communication materials, citizens will understand the reason for the study, the trigger points/timing for collection of stool and saliva samples, and the results of the tests. School science teachers are assisting with the recruitment and retention of volunteers and will be able to provide answers to questions at a local level.

Low Cost Sensors for Real-time Continuous Water Quality Monitoring in Georgia,EPA,Clean Water Act,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate select low-cost water quality sensors in comparison to industry standard equipment as part of a regional innovations initiative supported by the U.S. EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD). Non-point source monitoring programs, such as Georgia Environmental Protection Division’s (GAEPD’s) Georgia-Adopt-A-Stream (GA-AAS), that utilize citizen science data collected through volunteer monitoring efforts at the community level are vital to understanding base-line water quality conditions and the state of our nation’s waters. In recent years a rapid expansion of open source resources and support have made the design and deployment of low-cost water quality sensors accessible to watershed monitoring organizations, researchers, students, and citizen scientists alike. The U.S. EPA currently maintains an Air Sensor Toolbox for citizen scientists but there is no analogous resource for low-cost water quality sensors. There is currently very limited information on the capabilities and quality of data collected by these emerging low-cost alternatives.",Non-point source monitoring programs such as GA-AAS currently monitor a wide range of sites in different environments and conditions. This project took advantage of the pre-established network of active volunteers to assist in testing the ease of use and reliability of low cost water quality sensors. Citizen science eliminates the need to find installation locations and reduces travel and FTE on the part of EPA.,"The project started on January 23, 2018 in August 2017 and the sensor evaluation study with associated final report was completed in August 2018. . The use and testing of the sensors by volunteer monitoring organizations is ongoing.",EPA Region 4 (Southeast U.S.),"The project targeted active members of Adopt-A-Stream.

Smoke Sense,EPA,N/A,"Smoke Sense is a citizen science, crowdsourcing initiative that leverages individual citizen’s observations of wildland fire smoke and its health effects to broaden the knowledge base about smoke exposures and how they impact communities. Smoke Sense is facilitated through a mobile application that allows users to explore their current and forecasted daily air quality, maps of fire locations, and satellite images of smoke plumes. It also provides a means for users to learn about health consequences of exposure, record their own health effects, and explore smoke exposure and health in their local community. When combined with educational trivia games, these novel mobile health components promote preventive health behaviors. In total, Smoke Sense delivers an unprecedented degree of resources for wildfire smoke and air quality tracking and health effects management directly to citizen science users. EPA and other researchers will use the observations to determine the extent to which exposure to wildfire smoke affects health and productivity, and to help develop health risk communication strategies that improve public health on smoke days.",Citizen science and participatory research is the best way to reach individuals when and where hazardous conditions are likely to present as well as when and where individuals need the health risk information the most. The citizen science approach also facilitates democratization of knowledge and issue engagement in a way that other research approaches cannot.

Smoke from fires is a significant source of air pollution in the U.S. and globally. Among the pollutants found in smoke, fine particulate matter and ozone are strongly linked to cardiovascular and respiratory health effects. According to the 2011 National Emissions Inventory, 40% of fine particulate matter and 31% of volatile organic compounds that serve as pre-cursors to ozone formation are due to fires. Moreover, recent trends in factors contributing to the increased frequency and severity of these events, including growth of wildland urban interface, buildup of fuel, and weather patterns, are expected to continue. Additionally, as pollution from anthropogenic sources continues to decline, the relative contribution of smoke is expected to increase. Therefore, improving communication of health risks associated with this important source of two critical pollutants aligns with EPA’s missions and goals to protect public health.",Smoke Sense data and results will aim to bring about public health improvements by way of effectively supporting partner agencies who are more closely connected with their communities.

Community-led Air Sensor Evaluation in North Carolina,EPA,Clean Air Act,"EPA provided training to citizen scientists on how to successfully collocate low cost air quality sensors with regulatory monitors and then establish the ability of the sensor to provide purposeful air quality measurements. Low-cost sensors make it possible for citizens to collect air quality data in their own communities, but they still require instruction for optimal results. While low-cost sensors can measure many of the same air pollutants that costlier regulatory monitors measure, they are not required to meet the same rigorous standards of accuracy and reliability. Understanding how to collocate low-cost sensors with regulatory monitors and compare their results ensures that data from the low-cost monitors are collected in a purposeful manner.","It was paramount in the development of the sensor collocation tools to heavily draw on the perspective and account for the skill level of non-professional individuals. Air quality professionals typically possess skills and training to assess air quality instrumentation. Even so, many professionals have little or no experience operating low cost sensors. Therefore, even basic issues relative to using this type of technology cannot be assumed when EPA staff are working with its stakeholders. Teaming citizen scientists with no low-cost sensor experience and their highly variable skill levels with purposeful use of low cost sensors allowed EPA to gain insight on common questions others might encounter. The research ensured the concepts and topics described in tools produced by the EPA would be appropriate. Information gained from the research provided the means for EPA to develop a suite of tools widely transferrable to any low-cost air quality sensor stakeholder (citizen scientist, community group, industry, academia, regulatory officials). The partners in these efforts now have extensive knowledge on the strengths and weaknesses of low cost air quality sensors and how to best integrate this technology into their respective future efforts.",The project ran from April 2017 through June 2017 and is complete.,"The project is located in Mecklenburg County, NC and Cherokee, NC.","The project targeted the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI), a federally recognized Native American tribe living in and around the Cherokee, NC area. Clean Air Carolina (CAC) is a community action group in Charlotte, NC involved in a wide range of environmental air quality initiatives. The total number of individuals involved during this period was 14; an estimated two individuals/week participated from the EBCI and a total of four individuals participated from CAC during the May-June 2017 time period. The EBCI and CAC are estimated to have contributed a total of 200 hours to this research.","Individual memorandums of understanding were signed by representatives of both the CAC and the EBCI. In like manner, representatives consented to quality assurance requirements of the research.",The CAC and EBCI operated low cost air quality sensors for a one-month period using EPA-supplied operating procedures. They provided tabulated data documenting sensor measurements and technical feedback on tools useful in comparing sensor data with local regulatory measurements.,"The funding for this project was $58,000 in FY17 and $22,000 in FY18. A total of 0.8 FTEs were allocated in both fiscal years. Extramural support contract resources were used to assist in the development of a sensor collocation guide document and an accompanying tool used to assist low cost sensor users in establishing the performance characteristics of collocated instrumentation.","Non-Federal partners included the EBCI, CAC, and the Mecklenburg County Department of Air Quality.","The EPA views emerging technologies as being of benefit to future air quality monitoring. Even so, use of low cost air quality sensors represents one of the most technically challenging efforts undertaken by citizen scientists.  Many factors can influence air quality measurements (e.g., instrumentation design, environmental conditions). There currently exists no certification requirements for low cost sensors, resulting in a significant uncertainty by all parties as to the veracity of the measurements being obtained. States, regions, and program offices are sometimes confronted with low cost air quality data of unknown accuracy. The tools developed in this project provide the means for citizen scientists to establish the value of their measurements in advance of such discussions. The tools developed here are transferrable to any interested party including sensor manufacturers, who are expected to significantly advance the evolution of low cost sensors to the benefit of EPA and its full range of stakeholders.","EPA has developed a guide and analysis tool for citizen scientists to evaluate the performance of low-cost sensors and interpret the data they collect to help citizen scientists interested in learning about local air quality. The first tool is an instruction guide on conducting a successful collocation evaluation of low-cost air sensors. Collocation refers to the process of operating a regulatory grade reference monitor (FRM/FEM) and non-reference monitor (low-cost sensor) side-by-side in real-world conditions for a defined evaluation period. Collocating low-cost sensors with regulatory monitors can help citizen scientists evaluate their sensors’ performances and the accuracy of their data. The instruction guide contains links to web-based supporting materials and introduces users to the second product–-a macro analysis tool. EPA created the user-friendly, Excel-based macro analysis tool to help citizen scientists compare data from low-cost sensors to data from regulatory monitors, and interpret their results. The tool allows users to input data from low-cost and regulatory monitors for comparison, even if measurements were not recorded at precisely the same time, or were collected at different time intervals (e.g., 1-minute vs. 5- minute intervals). This tool addresses one of the major hurdles in citizen-led community air monitoring projects, which is working with and understanding the data. Both of the aforementioned tools are publicly available. The instruction guide and macro analysis tool are available at https://www.epa.gov/air-research/instruction-guide-and-macro-analysis-tool-community-led-air-monitoring.",No measurement data are currently available. The primary outputs of the project were the development of the collocation guide and the analysis tool. The day-to-day experience gained by the citizen scientists in operating low-cost sensors and their feedback on the resulting tools EPA developed to support such efforts were the primary data obtained during the research effort. The Office of Research and Development is currently reviewing the measurement data obtained during the study for any value as part of the Air Sensor Toolbox sensor performance reports provided to the public on individual sensor performance attributes.

Regional Sensor Loan Program,EPA,Clean Air Act,"This project gives EPA Regions the ability to investigate local and regional air quality using lower cost sensors through a sensor pod loan trial. EPA Regions and the communities they serve want to understand the pollutant concentrations in the air they breathe and want to be aware of potential pollution exposures in microenvironments where they live and work. Fixed regulatory monitoring networks might not be able to capture these local-scale conditions. Sensor pods are less expensive portable monitoring equipment that can provide finer spatial and temporal resolution than is possible with traditional monitoring. This trial loan program provides Regions with highly desired access to cutting edge sensor technology. Integration of the Regional need with the Office of Research and Development (ORD) success in sensor development relieves Regional partners of the technical burdens and maintenance aspects of having to develop a similar capability, while allowing ORD further opportunity to define the viability of low cost sensors to meet a wide range of stakeholder research needs.","ORD and each of the Regional partners have established citizen science efforts that this project builds upon. Previous programs have clearly shown the benefit of collaborative EPA-stakeholder research involving emerging low-cost sensor technologies. The lower cost of some sensor systems and relative ease of operation makes it possible for non-experts to use these technologies to gather air quality information. Some Regions are partnering with citizen scientists to build better relationships, address community concerns, and to teach them how to appropriately use sensor technologies. Each of the Regions has specific goals of their planned interactions with citizen scientists. Those goals will be fully established in FY19.",The project started in Spring 2018 and is ongoing.,"Region 1 – Mountain Valleys in Vermont; Region 2 – New York/New Jersey; Region 3 – Philadelphia, PA; Region 5 – Saginaw, MI; Region 8 – Denver, CO","The project targeted collection of community-level data by university students (Regions 2 and 5), community groups (Region 8), and State (Region 1) and Regional (Region 3) staff.",Human subjects and other considerations are currently in review by each of the Regional partners.

Federal staff evaluated research sensor options, explored the cost of the sensor pod creation, and developed partnerships. FY18 funding resources ($230,000 and 3.1 FTE) were used extramurally to obtain ORD-supported multi-pollutant sensor pods. The sensor pod specifications were selected collectively by the Regional partners with ORD providing technical expertise in that effort. ORD support included technical investigation of possible commercial sensor units for meeting project goals, developing needed quality assurance documentation (operating procedures) as well as establishing technical procedures for data collection and recovery. Resources were used to establish the operational status of each sensor pod including comparisons with reference monitors. Resources were used to support the development of an easy-to-use tool to process raw sensor signal into ambient concentrations, track and ship sensor pods to Regional partners, and to support Regional partners with troubleshooting during their loan period.","Federal partners included EPA Regions 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8. Non-Federal partners included the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation in Region 1; a Regional university (not yet selected) in Region 2; the City of Philadelphia in Region 3; Saginaw Valley State University in Region 5; and the City of Denver and two community groups in Region 8.","EPA’s mission is advanced through the efforts of ORD, the Regions, and the many stakeholders engaged in the project (States, municipalities, citizen science groups) to collaborate on the potential use of emerging technologies to meet community-based air monitoring research interests. Emerging technologies can collect air quality data at finer spatial and temporal resolution and at a lower cost than traditional monitoring equipment. However, the accuracy of these measurements can vary considerably not only based on the sensors used but also on integration (e.g., sensor pod design) and environmental conditions (e.g., metrology, pollutant concentration, particle types). States, Regions, and program offices find these technologies potentially valuable but often lack the staff and resources to try technologies that are not well characterized. Additionally, these groups are often confronted with data from their stakeholders with little or no understanding of their accuracy. This project supports the Regions by helping them to access technology that ORD finds promising, supporting them with some technical support and documents (e.g., operating procedures), and introducing them to processes that help ensure data quality (e.g., collocation). The projects selected will help demonstrate potential uses for sensors and develop closer relationships between EPA and project partners.",Each of the Regional partners are engaged in fully establishing all of their individual research efforts.  Region 1’s goal is to measure wintertime particulate matter concentrations in valley locations. Region 2’s goal is to engage students in a community with environmental justice (EJ) concerns to measure air pollutants and better understand their local air pollution. Region 3’s goal is to engage EJ communities and to investigate particulate matter concentrations in two such communities. Region 5’s goal is to engage college students in air quality monitoring to address local air quality concerns. Region 8’s goal is to engage community groups in air quality monitoring using sensors to further their environmental awareness activities.,"No data are currently available due to the current status of the study. Citizen science data collections are scheduled to begin in FY19. ORD will be releasing quality assurance data collected while sensors are collocated with reference instruments both at the EPA facility in Research Triangle Park, NC and similar data while deployed within the Regions. These data and summarized findings will be made publicly available at the end of the project when researchers intend to publish a report on the performance of the multi- pollutant sensor pod (estimated to be in FY20). Regions and their project partners are currently establishing data handling and public data release policies for each of their individual research efforts."
Ironbound Neighborhood Air Monitoring,EPA,Clean Air Act,"This collaboration provided for community-based participatory environmental monitoring of the particulate matter 2.5 micron size fraction (PM2.5) and gaseous nitrogen dioxide (NO2), as pollutants chosen jointly by the EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD), Region 2, and the Ironbound Community using an environmental sensor pod designed by ORD for the particular needs of the community. ORD provided technical commentary on the general research study plans developed by the Ironbound Community/Region 2 and provided data analysis expertise concerning data summarization options ultimately shared with the community. The primary objective of this effort was to develop the approach (Toolbox) needed to support such activities and ensure their success.","EPA aims to address environmental concerns of vulnerable populations in its research programs. Community-based citizen science efforts have the potential of providing Americans with new information sources useful for understanding local air quality. The Air Sensor Toolbox’s technical resources developed for the Ironbound Community represent an example for use by other communities across the country in developing their own air monitoring programs in areas where pollution is a concern. As such, the pilot effort provided EPA an opportunity to work directly with a highly motived citizen science organization, develop a collaboratively agreed upon research plan, and introduce advanced technology to the citizen scientists to meet their needs. The pilot project provided useful lessons in how to improve coordination between EPA and communities, the types of tools and technologies needed to assist communities, and how the lessons learned from this pilot study might be applied to future efforts.",The project started in June 2014 and was completed in June 2016.,"The project is located in Newark, New Jersey.","The project targeted the Ironbound Community Corporation. The total number of individuals involved was estimated to be around 20, and the average number of active participants per week was estimated to be 3-4 individuals. The total number of volunteer hours was in the range of 300 to 500.",No personal monitoring took place.  Ironbound Community Corporation secured individual citizen scientists with their principal member providing consent for the effort and being a signatory on all major project documents.,Participants were asked to recover air quality data weekly from a total of four sensor pods. Participants tabulated raw data and provided those electronic data files to EPA for validation and processing,No funds were specifically allocated for this project and less than 0.1 FTEs were used in FY17 and FY18. All primary work was completed in FY14-FY16. EPA activity centered around handling study inquiries and submitting a journal article that summarized the findings.,Non-Federal partners included the Ironbound Community Corporation and the New Jersey Department of the Environment.,"EPA’s mission is to protect human health and the environment. To move toward achieving this goal, EPA is facilitating identification of potential environmental concerns, particularly in vulnerable communities. This includes actively supporting citizen science projects and providing communities with the information and assistance they need to conduct their own air pollution monitoring efforts. The Air Sensor Toolbox for Citizen Scientists was developed as a resource to meet stakeholder needs. The Toolbox features resources developed by EPA researchers that can be used by citizens to effectively collect, analyze, interpret, and communicate air quality data. The resources include information about sampling methods, how to calibrate and validate monitors, options for measuring air quality, data interpretation guidelines, and low-cost sensor performance information. By testing emerging air sensor technologies, the EPA is evaluating new methods to support its core mission of protecting human health and the environment.","A primary purpose of this effort was the development of needed citizen science tools. These included quality assurance documentation and similar documentation that would be transferable to other communities interested in conducting citizen science air quality research. These tools were publicly released as part of ORD’s Citizen Science Toolbox, which can be accessed at https://www.epa.gov/air-sensor-toolbox. In addition, the Ironbound Community received valuable training in how to conduct complex air quality monitoring and its validation. Study results were jointly presented by EPA and the citizen science team to the full community. The community received in-depth air quality information collected by their own citizens highlighting the observed environmental concentrations and how their measurements related to the national air quality standards and other similar communities. This effort provided EPA with invaluable lessons learned on how to plan and execute complex air quality citizen science research efforts.",Data have been publicly available since the publication of the primary peer review journal article summarizing key findings.

The Efficacy of Citizen Science Air Monitoring for Building Public Awareness of Exposures in a US Caribbean Urban Neighborhood Impacted by Heavy Industrial Contamination,EPA,Clean Air Act,"A research partnership with a Puerto Rico-based regional consortium, Desarrollo Integral del Sur, Inc. (DISUR), was developed to determine the challenges and benefits of low-cost air quality (AQ) sensors for citizen science. EPA developed a unique low-cost multi-pollutant sensor pod that was provided to the community group and the training/tools needed for its operation. The citizens self-organized a community effort to conduct approximately five months of intensive AQ monitoring in residential areas of Guayanilla and Peñuelas, Puerto Rico, which had little historical data on spatial variability. The citizens successfully completed the intensive data collections, summary of quality assurance checks, and database development. The study provided environmental justice communities in Peñuelas and Guayanilla, as well as surrounding communities, an awareness of local air quality conditions and opportunities for citizen scientists to gain extensive experience in use of emerging sensor technologies. The collaboration provided EPA an opportunity to evaluate low-cost sensor performance under harsh environmental conditions (high relative humidity in a coastal environment).","Citizens in the study area had an established interest in environmental air quality issues in southern Puerto Rico. In particular, they had concerns about air pollutants from a variety of potential sources including abandoned industrial sites that they did not feel were being fully characterized. Establishing a citizen science project allowed the local communities to be directly involved in not only selected monitoring sites of interest but also providing them with extensive training and experience on the use of emerging air quality technologies (low cost sensors). This project provided the EPA the ability to gain seminal knowledge on the ability of low cost air quality sensors to operate in the harsh Caribbean climate (high temperatures, high relative humidity, and abundant rainfall) for extended periods of time (about six months). The reliability of low cost sensors (environmental impacts as well as lifetime of performance) has not been established and there currently exists no manufacturer’s certification of performance. Therefore, the information gained by the project involving non-professional operation and collection of environmental data was highly valuable in establishing “lessons learned” under such conditions. The citizen science project provided direct feedback to local citizens using a credible source (e.g., other community members), therefore providing enhanced understanding about the local air quality conditions from data collection that was not government based.",The project started in October 2016 and is complete.,"The project took place in Peñuelas and Guayanilla, Puerto Rico.","The project targeted community members in Peñuelas and Guayanilla, Puerto Rico. The total number of individuals involved over the full course of the study (October 2016 through February 2018) was 23 participants. Citizen scientists and community group members contributed an estimated 500 total hours.","Consent was received from 20 community members and 3 DISUR staff members.  DISUR, as the primary community leader, was a signatory on all key project documents (e.g., QA documentation, community recruitment/training activities).",Participants deployed a number of EPA-developed low cost air quality sensor pods and weather monitors at sites community members selected. Data were harvested on a weekly basis. Tabulated data were then provided to EPA.,"FY17 funding ($100,000 and 1 FTE) was used for an extramural support contract that provided the means to develop the low cost sensor pods, establish and conduct a training program for the Puerto Rico-based citizen scientists, and ultimately establish the community-based leadership support with DISUR needed to facilitate citizen science activities, and air quality data collection. Extramural funding was also used for technical support needed to conduct quality assurance review of raw tabulated data provided by the citizen scientists.  FY18 funding ($100,000 and 1 FTE) was used for an extramural support contract provided for DISUR to conduct data quality assurance validation efforts and refinement of the tabulated database they had established.",Non-Federal partners included DISUR Community group and the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board.,"EPA is involved in the discovery, evaluation, and application of low-cost air quality sensors to meet a wide variety of stakeholder needs. One key feature of this effort is the determination of low-cost sensor performance under real-world conditions. The EPA is recognized as one of the premier research organizations in the world investigating the value and potential of emerging air quality sensor technology for evaluating air quality. EPA is also actively supporting citizen scientists by transferring knowledge gained from its own research and directly engaging with them in the pursuit of community-based interests.","Air quality information obtained during the study was directly shared with local citizens by a joint Office of Research and Development/EPA Region 2/DISUR team in February 2018 to mark the completion of the study. At this meeting, air quality information collected during the study was related to historical regulatory monitoring. In particular, validated data from the citizen science study indicated environmental concentrations of the select air pollutants monitored were well below ambient air quality values during the study period. While the study was not long-term and used non-regulatory monitors, citizens received unprecedented information on their local air quality. The maritime climate encountered during the study provided EPA a great deal of performance data on low cost sensors. Data findings revealed that extensive data validation and processing was needed to overcome interference with high relative humidity for many of the low-cost sensors. Data validation techniques developed during that portion of the study are directly transferrable to future EPA field efforts involving this same type of technology. Sensor performance characteristics are not typically known because of the lack of a required manufacturer’s certification requirement. Data findings from this study will be published in the peer reviewed literature summarizing the viability of low cost technology to meet air quality monitoring needs under harsh operating conditions.","The data obtained during the study will be publically available upon publication of a submitted peer reviewed journal article. Data will be obtainable at the EPA environmental dataset gateway, accessible at https://edg.epa.gov. The dataset can be retrieved by searching for The Peñuelas Project-SCID:A-K99b or by the name of the senior EPA author, Ron Williams."

Aurorasaurus,NASA,N/A,"In 2013, NSF funded a research team to build the first citizen science project around observing the aurora. The Aurorasaurus.org project was funded for its innovative interdisciplinary goals around geospace, informal science education, and human-centered computing. This project had two fundamental objectives which have been successfully achieved: (1) collect real-time, ground-based aurora data from citizen scientists (soft sensors) and (2) incorporate this new type of data into scientific investigations pertaining to aurora. In 2016, NASA provided funding as part of the Space Science Education Consortium and its nation-wide education goals.","Crowdsourcing and citizen science are the only way to provide these newly available data, enabled by smart phones, digital cameras, and social media sources like Twitter. There are no other real-time verified sources of data indicating accurately where the dynamic aurora are visible (e.g. no imaging satellites, and no cameras that extract the actual locations). This is a unique service for the public who are interested in this information and the scientists who use these data to supplement and ground-truth traditional sources of data about the aurora. There are dedicated communities world-wide who can contribute and benefit by increasing their scientific literacy. In addition, the larger and more rare the auroral event, the less traditional data sources (e.g., ground-based scientific cameras) exist to document the rarer phenomena (e.g., the newly recognized STEVE aurora-like phenomena), and the more citizen scientists can contribute.","The project started in 2012, and is ongoing.","The whole globe, primarily in polar regions.","The project targeted (1) citizen scientists who see the aurora and want to submit an observation about it; and (2) anyone who is interested to help verify crowdsourced data about the aurora, accomplished through the verify tweets feature.

Disk Detective,NASA,"51 USC § 20111, et seq.","NASA’s Wide Field Infrared Explorer (WISE) mission is a discovery tool sensitive enough to detect several thousand debris disks out to 300 parsecs and Young Stellar Objects to 1 kiloparsecs. These circumstellar disks are signposts of planets and serve as roadmaps to guide exoplanet searches and increase understanding of planet formation. However, the confusion noise inherent in the WISE mission data has limited the usefulness of this resource as a tool for disk and planet hunters. The Disk Detective project uses the power of citizen science to remedy this confusion noise problem in the WISE data. Disk Detective engages volunteers to compare images from WISE, NASA’s Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), and optical surveys to search for new circumstellar disk candidates via the website DiskDetective.org. This project is the largest survey for debris disks with WISE and has already uncovered approximately 4,000 disk candidates worthy of follow-up, including 24 late type dwarfs too red for Hipparcos.

Image Detective,NASA,"51 USC § 20111, et seq.","Image Detective was developed in direct response to decreases in funding from the International Space Station Program for astronaut photography cataloging (geolocation by image geographic centerpoint and addition of descriptive geographic metadata) at Johnson Space Center. Since members of the public continued to submit data from their own image cataloging and provided positive feedback regarding the usefulness of cataloged imagery, development of a crowdsourcing interface to allow for official public cataloging was the logical next step. The geographical knowledge  and other STEM educational benefits to the public are self-evident—participants must examine features in an astronaut photograph and locate those same features in other georeferenced data (e.g. Google Earth) in order to derive a geographic centerpoint. By doing this, participants are gaining better knowledge of Earth’s physiographic diversity as well as the current geopolitical landscape. ","While astronaut photography of Earth holds many potential benefits for long-term change studies, the limitations of the dataset (3-band visible wavelength data; high variability in terms of look angle and sun illumination; variable ground sample distance; no native georeferencing data) have acted to limit its application and recognition among the remote sensing community. As a result, requests for proposals amenable to astronaut photography as a primary science dataset have been few and far between. Grant funding did not represent a viable approach for development or long-term support of the NASA-managed Image Detective. Rather, the International Space Station Program provides stable funding for ongoing mission support of new astronaut photography of Earth, as well as curation of the online database of historical imagery at Johnson Space Center. As many of the components of Image Detective were already in place as part of existing cataloging, database, and website tools, and NASA’s team held software and web design skillsets, crowdsourcing and citizen science could be incorporated into ongoing funded activities. As mentioned previously, allied education/outreach efforts and public feedback on NASA’s online database indicated a strong public interest in astronaut photography and willingness to participate in cataloging of astronaut images of Earth. A crowsourcing and citizen science interface was both feasible with existing resources and the appropriate mechanism for public engagement.",The project started in 2013 and is ongoing.,"The photographs cover all regions of Earth’s surface between approximately 52 degrees North and South latitudes, however the dataset is spatially and temporally discontinuous for some regions.","The project targets the general public.

Astronaut photography of the Earth has been collected by every crewed NASA mission since the Mercury Program and thus represents the longest continuously-collected orbital image record of changes to the Earth surface supporting a wide range of geologic, oceanographic, and climatic research. As the images are acquired by human beings using visible-wavelength (true color) cameras rather than robotic sensors, the public has an intuitive connection to the images that strengthens interest and aids in image interpretation, making the dataset powerful for educational applications.","The primary use of the Image Detective results is for reducing the backlog of uncatalogued astronaut photography of Earth. In addition, the crowdsourcing and citizen science cataloged data are used to add images to specific collections available through NASA’s online astronaut photography database website (e.g., volcanos, cities) and for allied education and outreach programs. As the data cataloged through Image Detective are added to the publicly available online database, the data become more useful for downstream scientific and educational applications by other users of the database.","Once data submitted through the NASA Image Detective have been passed through a QA/QC review, the location, cloud cover, and feature metadata are added to the specific image records in the publicly accessible online database, the Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth (https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/). An image with metadata obtained from an Image Detective participant is identified as “Public Inputs (from public image detectives, not NASA)” in the image details section of the image data record. "

Chesapeake Bay Parasite Project,Smithsonian Institution,N/A,"White-fingered mud Crabs (Rhithropanopeus harrissi) are small scavengers native to the Chesapeake Bay that live in oyster reefs and woody debris in the water where they play a key role in the food web structure of this ecosystem. They may also be an indicator species, which means that the health of their population is a direct reflection of the health of their habitat. Mud crabs typically live less than two years, which means they do not have a long time to reproduce. The parasitic barnacle Loxothylacus panopaei (Loxo, for short) is an invasive species that castrates these mud crabs when it infects them. Though this project, Smithsonian scientists seek to understand how Loxo affects the mud crab population. Specifically, are mud crab populations steady or are they declining because Loxo hinders their reproduction?","Engaging citizen scientists enables collection of large amounts of data in a very short period of time.

By enlisting the public’s help in transcribing and reviewing scientific field notes, annual reports, correspondence, and more, the Transcription Center promotes the discoverability and use of scientific data by professional researchers and laypeople.","The Smithsonian Transcription Center was designed as a crowdsourcing project because there was a defined need across the institution to increase and improve the accessibility of collections that could not be achieved by staff due to limited time and financial resources. Previous transcription projects were done by staff members, contractors, or interns, on a project-by-project basis, when time and resources permitted. Through crowdsourcing with digital volunteers, the stories and information locked within the Smithsonian’s digitized collections is made accessible on a level far beyond the abilities of Smithsonian staff. On average, digital volunteers transcribe and review over seventy-five pages of material per day. The choice to enlist the public in this project for crowdsourcing transcriptions additionally fits into the Smithsonian Institution’s mission of engaging the public in the increase and diffusion of knowledge. Scientific field books and other archival materials were seen as particularly relevant and important for inclusion into the Transcripiton Center, as transcriptions of this content would help further unlock hidden data for researchers around the world.",The project started in June 2013 and is ongoing.,Archival documents pertaining to locations throughout the United States and beyond.,"The project targets any member of the public interested in helping transcribe Smithsonian archival collections related to science and biodiversity. From launch of the Smithsonian Transcription Center in 2013 through the end of FY18, a total of 11,889 individuals have registered on the platform.  In FY17-18 alone, the community grew by 4551 registered users, 2927 of whom actively transcribed material.",Participation by all individuals is voluntary.,"Participants, or “digital volunteers”, are asked to transcribe and review digitized Smithsonian archival materials related to science and biodiversity, including field notes from scientific expeditions, annual reports of Smithsonian scientific departments, and correspondence from Smithsonian scientific curators. Their efforts make the data within the archival materials more accessible (more readable and keyword searchable) for the scientists and the general public.","The Smithsonian Transcription Center crowdsourcing platform is supported by the Smithsonian’s Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO).  OCIO staff oversee operations and continued development of the platform, working in close coordination with colleagues in the Smithsonian museums and research centers that contribute collections for transcription.  A full-time project coordinator sponsored by OCIO supports unit staff (equivalent to 2-3 FTEs) in utilizing the system and fosters the Center’s vibrant community of Digital Volunteers.",N/A,"The Smithsonian Transcription Center advances the Institution’s historic mission to “increase and diffuse knowledge” by providing a pan-institutional digital platform where the public can take part in making treasures now held in Smithsonian museums, libraries, and archives accessible to the world. The program, which presents materials for transcription spanning the fields of science, history, art, and culture, supports the goals of the current Strategic Plan of engaging and inspiring millions more people—locally and around the globe—through audience-focused pan-Institutional initiatives.",N/A,"All completed (i.e., transcribed and reviewed) pages are made available to the public online. Transcribed content is always available on the Smithsonian Transcription Center website (transcription.si.edu) on both the project pages themselves and through downloadable pdfs (as individual pages or fully completed projects).  The original digitized images of the material being transcribed remain next to the completed transcription for reference. Transcription Center completed pages and projects are also linked internally with the Smithsonian’s online, public-facing databases: Collections Search Center (http://collections.si.edu/search/) and the Smithsonian’s Online Virtual Archive (https://sova.si.edu/). Within minutes of a page being transcribed, the transcribed content automatically appears alongside the digitized collection page in these online databases and is text searchable."
Virginia Working Landscapes: Grasslands Biodiversity Survey,Smithsonian Institution,N/A,"Virginia Working Landscapes (VWL) is a program of the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) that promotes the conservation of native biodiversity and sustainable land-use through research, education, and community engagement. Its goals are to: (1) Create a community network to promote dissemination of information from neighbor to neighbor; (2) Network landowners with State and Federal agencies that can provide them with specific technical and financial assistance; (3) Establish and highlight demonstration sites on working farms that showcase best practices for different land uses, agricultural production, and biodiversity management; and (4) Advance the science of land management and develop best practices relevant both to working farmers and conservationists.","Citizen science allows VWL to gather data over a large geographic area (incorporating 16 counties) from private landholdings. VWL’s focus is on engagement with the community of concerned citizens over a multi-county region of central and northern Virginia, over the broad topic of biological conservation. Citizen science is a means to recruit, train, and continuously provide outreach and education materials to the community. In turn, citizen scientists become ambassadors for the program and the Smithsonian Institution. The program convenes a large audience of citizen scientists, landowners, researchers, other non-profit organizations, and natural resource industry service providers through Smithsonian’s field work, frequent training, and enrichment opportunities. The citizen scientists make a direct contribution to research, increase their scientific understanding, and are allowed to immerse themselves in the field of conservation. This all results in highly impactful, personally transformative experiences for the citizen scientist volunteers. The project encourages not only good conservation, but also good community-based, person-to-person networking around a good cause.",The project started in January 2010 and is ongoing.,"The project is located in Northern and Central Virginia, Northern Blue Ridge and Northern Piedmont ecoregions.","The project targets landowners, research professionals, naturalist volunteers, government and non-government natural resource organizations, conservation land trusts, and for-profit land management businesses. The project involved 83 citizen scientists in 2017 and 64 in 2018. The total number of volunteer hours was 1.19 FTEs.",Participation by the 131 individuals involved in FY17 and FY18 was voluntary.,"Participants submitted ecological monitoring data, photographs, and plant and animal specimens collected from the field.",The program required 0.54 FTEs in FY18.,Non-Federal partners include Blandy Experimental Farm and State Arboretum; Piedmont Environmental Council; Blue Ridge PRISM; Smithsonian-Mason School of Conservation; National Bobwhite Conservation Initiative; Virginia Master Naturalists; Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries.,"The Smithsonian’s mission is to increase and diffuse knowledge. Virginia Working Landscapes is a program of the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute that promotes the conservation of native biodiversity and sustainable land-use through research, education, and community engagement.","Through the development of consistent survey protocols and rigorous volunteer training, the data from VWL surveys has begun to yield results that can be applied to local land management. For example, it is now known that native warm-season grass meadows, such as those established through bobwhite quail conservation programs, support higher densities of declining shrubland birds and overwintering birds. Similarly, citizen scientists study how human activities influence movement patterns of the region’s carnivores, explore how urban development impacts bumblebee populations, and identify relationships between native plants, land management, and wildlife. These studies can help delineate areas of conservation priority while engaging landowners and educating them regarding best practices for biodiversity. The results of the analyses derived from data collected through our citizen science project are disseminated to regional planning entities, policy makers, the scientific community, VWL’s partner organizations, and landowners. Results appear in peer-reviewed journals and publications as well as through SI media channels and other popular print and online publications. On average, outreach effort includes over twenty formal presentations a year and include hosting or attending at least ten other public outreach events in our region. An additional 5000+ people are reached through social media and website visits each year. Analyses are useful to natural resource agency regulators and partners for identifying population trends among a host of plant and wildlife species, some of which are currently federally endangered or considered at-risk, and many of which are considered in decline. This knowledge will contribute to a growing body of knowledge around grasslands ecology, particularly in the area of grassland breeding birds, native pollinators, the impacts of invasive or introduced plant species on the biodiversity, overall health, and stability of grass-dominated ecosystems in the eastern United States. In addition, each landowner on whose property a survey is conducted is provided an annual report summarizing all the data collected in a given year. Results provide an important input for landowners and land managers, and form a foundation for making good land management decisions.","Data collected by VWL citizen scientists has in the past been made publically available through the website, but due to the sensitive, proprietary nature of private property, and the need to protect the identities of landowners and other private citizens, the practice of publically releasing this information has been ended. VWL intends to explore ways to make the data available in the future through the publication of results."
