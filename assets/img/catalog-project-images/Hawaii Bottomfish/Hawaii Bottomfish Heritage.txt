Hi,

I submitted information about our citizen science project via google forms and am sending this image to accompany it.

1) caption: Hawaii Bottomfish Heritage Project logo
2) photo credit: NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center
3) This logo can be shared publicly

We have or can create the logo in other file formats and resolutions, if necessary.

Thanks,
Kirsten
