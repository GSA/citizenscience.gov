Did you know that April is Citizen Science Month? Each year, the [CitizenScience.Gov](www.citizenscience.gov) team celebrates the power of public participation in the scientific process to address real-world problems. Agencies across the federal government use community science and participatory research to create meaningful forms of scientific collaboration with the public.

This past April we held a spotlight chat featuring our partners at NASA to learn about their approach to participatory research. Leaders from two NASA sponsored projects, Are We Alone in the Universe? and Chesapeake Water Watch Project, shared how they collaborate between scientists and interested members of the public. 

**The Power of Citizen Science to Advance NASA’s Mission**

NASA Astrophysicist and Citizen Science Officer Marc Kuchner gave an overview of how NASA works to make scientific discovery more transparent and to increase scientific inclusivity. They work with more than 2 million volunteers from 167 countries across the globe. “We are proud these volunteer projects are held to the same rigorous standards as any NASA science project,” Marc said. Twenty-three of those projects can be done by anyone, anywhere with just a laptop or cell phone. 

Marc went on to describe accomplishments of NASA volunteers. “Through the projects more than 400 volunteers have become co-authors on refereed published papers all online on the website,” he said. There are currently 36 current projects open to the public to take part in. At least 12 NASA science teams have regular meetings with their volunteers. NASA’s volunteer science projects have come to dominate multiple scientific fields, having discovered:
* Most of the known comets
* All of the known samples of interstellar material
* Most of the ultracool brown dwarfs
* ⅓ of Kepler’s long period exoplanets.

**Are We Alone In the Universe?**

Astronomer Jean-Luc Margot from UCLA SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) spoke about Are We Alone in the Universe?, a research project that seeks the public’s help in finding signs of extraterrestrial intelligence. “Is there intelligent life on the other planets and if so, can we communicate with another civilization?”, he asked. 

Finding another example of life of any kind outside of Earth is a high scientific priority and will significantly advance our understanding of living systems. One way to look for life in the universe is the search for technosignatures. There are millions of signals out in the world and the project tries to identify potential technosignatures from extraterrestrial civilizations. Since 2016, UCLA SETI has detected over 60 million radio signals, most of which are due to terrestrial technology. Volunteer scientists help classify these signals with the goal of identifying technosignatures from extraterrestrial civilizations. The project's website is arewealone.earth.

**Chesapeake Water Watch**

The Chesapeake Bay is widely accessed and used for both recreational and economic purposes. The Bay has major ecological issues such as high algal blooms, sedimentation influxes, and pollution. Shelby Brown, Citizen Science Program Coordinator with the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, described the efforts the Chesapeake Water Watch Project is taking to address these ecological issues. The project is a participatory science program where Chesapeake Bay locals are helping track the health of the Bay using their smartphones. Volunteers use a water quality app that estimates water clarity through the upload of three photos that can detect the reflectance of natural water bodies and then conclude various properties of the water. These measurements are used by researchers to help improve high resolution satellite images to accurately monitor the Bay. 

“We recruit volunteers and process the data and water samples collected by them. The Bay is large and volunteers really help us cover it by being an extended part of the research team,” Shelby said. With support from NASA, the project is a collaboration between the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center and the City College of New York.

After a little more than a year, the Chesapeake Water Watch project has had 900 observations from volunteers that are then validated in the lab. Along with that data, the remote sensing team from the City College of New York adjusts algorithms and cross-references the data from field scopes with the satellite data, which helps to improve the accuracy and resolution of the final image.

**Celebrating Citizen Science**

The celebration was a great way to learn about NASA’s participatory research projects and the impact volunteers have from many different professional backgrounds all over the world. As summarized by Marc, “We really need your help and each minute you spend on these is helping advance NASA science and we are grateful for the hours that people are contributing to the projects.”

Inclusion, collaboration, and scientific advancement are values that motivate [CitizenScience.Gov](www.citizenscience.gov). The [Community Collaborative Rain, Hail, and Snow Network (CoCoRaHS) Network](https://www.citizenscience.gov/catalog/81/#), in partnership with the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Education](https://www.noaa.gov/office-education), illustrates these values. CoCoRaHS strives to bridge the gap between the federal government and the public to foster inclusive participation in scientific discovery. The new CoCoRaHS Data Explorer is a powerful tool for the public to engage with environmental data like never before. Currently, with more than 25,000 active CoCoRaHS stations, collecting +14,000 reports per day, there have been nearly 72 million records collected in the last 26 years. Now, with the [CoCoRaHS Data Explorer](https://dex.cocorahs.org/), this wealth of information is easily accessible and understandable for all. 

The CoCoRaHS Data Explorer was made possible through a grant from NOAA's Office of Education, and donations from CoCoRaHS supporters. “They really have gone above and beyond with the grant funding we provided”, said John McLaughlin, Education Program Manager with NOAA and Federal Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science (FedCCS) community of practice co-chair. “Many of our funding opportunities focus on community resilience. We have found that many projects to create resilience to climate change use CoCoRaHS as a tool.”
 
The CoCoRaHS network launched in 1998 in partnership with the [Colorado Climate Center at Colorado State University](https://climate.colostate.edu/). Since then, CoCoRaHS volunteers of all ages have diligently measured and mapped precipitation and their efforts have generated multitudes of invaluable data. To be part of the collaborative, the only requirement is that all volunteers must use the same type of manual rain gauge for data collection. NOAA partners with CoCoRaHS to recruit and train volunteers to measure and map precipitation (rain, hail, and snow), and data is collected in all 50 states and territories and all Canadian provinces. 

Anyone can use the CoCoRaHS Data Explorer tool to find and view precipitation normals and compare real data using innovative data visualization products. CoCoRaHS data are combined with weather information from satellites, radar, and other sources to create the daily participation maps published by the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/). 

“CoCoRaHS volunteers are happy to ‘ground truth’ what radar and satellite might be seeing in between the gaps where no data currently exists. CoCoRaHS is filling those gaps,” said Noah Newman, Research Coordinator for the Colorado Climate Center, and Education and Outreach Coordinator for CoCoRaHS.

CoCoRaHS data are used by a wide variety of groups, agencies, companies, schools, and more. For example, the data are used for infrastructure development planning, as structures including bridges, spillways, and dams must be designed to withstand extreme levels of precipitation. Additionally, farmers and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) use CoCoRaHS data to understand crop conditions, plan irrigation, and for market cycle predictions. Whether it's farmers planning irrigation or engineers designing infrastructure, the insights gleaned from volunteer-collected data are vitally important. 

The CoCoRaHS initiative, with the support of NOAA, is just one collaborative project between federal government agencies and the public featured on [CitizenScience.Gov](www.citizenscience.gov). Citizen science projects empower individuals to actively contribute to and participate in scientific research. These projects increase public trust in science, advance scientific knowledge, and embody inclusive and participatory approaches to scientific research. Projects like CoCoRaHS lead us to a greater understanding of our natural world and more effective environmental stewardship.
