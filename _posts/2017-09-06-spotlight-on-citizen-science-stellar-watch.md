Here is a chance to be a citizen scientist and participate in research about endangered Steller sea lions from your own home!

You can help NOAA Fisheries scientists obtain new information about these sea lions in the Aleutian Islands.Through a project called Steller Watch, an online community is helping review and classify hundreds of thousands of photos of remote steller sea lion sites, saving researchers critical time.
