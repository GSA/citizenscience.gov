###### Summer Spotlight is a summer-long initiative organized by the Office of Education at NOAA to showcase citizen science projects from across the agency.

Urban Tides Community Science Initiative

USC Sea Grant launched the Urban Tides Community Science Initiative, a #CitizenScience program that links observations of community members across Southern California with scientists and city leaders working on climate change. The goal is for people to photograph tidal lines, coastal flooding, and erosion, and upload images into the Urban Tides database. Evaluations of Urban Tides beach walk participants show that community members gain new knowledge of sea level rise and climate change. USC Sea Grant has built partnerships with non-formal education centers, schools, nonprofit organizations, and local municipalities in Southern California to engage communities in this effort.
