project_description: "Once a month, volunteers watch, count, and record sea turtle sightings for 30 minutes at stations arranged at set intervals along the San Gabriel River where sea turtles are known to reside. The data collected is recorded and used to help understand the ecology and population dynamics of green turtles in the northern extent of their range along the U.S. west coast."
