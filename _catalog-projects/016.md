project_description: "The Delaware Bay Horseshoe Crab Survey was founded in 1990, and received government support beginning in 1999. Volunteers collect data on Horseshoe crabs through beach surveys, providing critical information for scientists and policymakers about Horseshoe crab populations in the Delaware Bay. Data from the survey has helped the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) set protocols for commercial fishing. Limuli Labs, a company that relies on horseshoe crabs to support medical research and practice, provides funding for the project website.  "
