The volunteers take an instrument and take water column profiles in several locations which are turned into environmental bulletins."

project_goals: "To collect data about offshore and nearshore conditions before, during and after red tides on the Gulf coast of Florida. We are particularly interested in monitoring the development of hypoxic (low oxygen) areas that can be devastating to marine life. The data are used to make fishery management decisions and being used to develop hypoxia forecasting capabilities."
