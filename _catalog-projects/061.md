project_description: "Volunteers from Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation, with support from the the National Forest Foundation, and in partnership with the U.S. Forest Service, gathered more than 3000 camera-nights of data on wildlife in remote areas of the High Uintas Wilderness.  A crew of thirty hikers, ultra-marathon runners, and backpackers maintained 30 cameras that required hikes of 10 to 25 miles to reach.  During four months the project recorded 15 species and a database of 20,000 images and videos."
