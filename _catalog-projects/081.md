The use of regional coordinators who coordinate local volunteers has enabled the project to scale up to its current size and scope. As of March 2015, a CoCoRaHS rain gauge was installed in the First Lady's Kitchen Garden in the white house.

project_description: "CoCoRaHS is a network of community weather monitors active in all 50 states and several Canadian provinces. As of Marcy 2015, CoCoRaHS included over 20,000 volunteers. Educational materials for schools and 4-H programs may be found on the project website. CoCoRaHS data is combined with weather information from satellites, radar, and other sources to create the daily participation maps published by the national weather service. CoCoRaHS data is also used to plan infrastructure development, as structures including bridges, spillways, and damns must be designed to weather extreme levels of participation. In addition, farmers and the USDA use CoCoRaHS data to understand crop conditions, plan irrigation, and predict market cycles."
