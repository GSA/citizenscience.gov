project_name: Mountain Rain or Snow
project_url: https://rainorsnow.org/home
project_description: "Itâ€™s notoriously difficult to research winter precipitation in the mountains as precipitation phase (rain, snow, or mixed) can vary over the course of minutes and across short distances. Human observers are our best resource for discovering how rain and snow vary in time and space. Mountain Rain or Snow is a citizen science project devoted to collecting real-time observations of precipitation phase."
project_topic: Climate and weather, Geology and earth science, Nature and outdoors

project_goals: "Crowdsourced reports of rain, snow, and mixed precipitation will help us and other scientists improve remote sensing products and hydrologic models to better estimate what type of precipitation falls during winter storms."
