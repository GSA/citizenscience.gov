project_description: "Kelp forests scientists need your help. We have hundreds of thousands of images of kelp forests taken from space, and need your discerning eye to help us tell kelp from everything else - waves, seagrass beds, even the Google headquarters. We ask you to take a look at a picture of a slice of coastline around the world, and simply circle any kelp you see. So come join us on this global tour of one of the world's most productive ecosystems!"
