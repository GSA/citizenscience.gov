types_volunteers: "The app is intended for use by the USGS and its collaborators and will not function without an approved login. It is a powerful new tool to help scientists and coastal resource managers consistently measure and assess the birds’ response to changes to their habitat. Rather than compiling data from multiple sources and formats, the app gives trained resource managers an easy-to-use platform where they can collect and instantly share data across a diverse community of field technicians, scientists, and managers. iPlover improves scientists’ data gathering and analysis capabilities by simplifying and facilitating consistent data collection and management that interfaces with models of shoreline change and beach geomorphology."

project_description: "Quantifying coastal habitat utilization with smartphones! Understanding and managing dynamic coastal landscapes for beach-dependent species requires biological and geological data across the range of relevant environments and habitats. It is difficult to acquire such data; many data collections focus on either the biology or the geology, are collected by non-specialists, and lack observational uniformity. iPlover is an app that addresses these difficulties, and simplifies and facilitates consistent data collection, management, and enables direct data input into research models of habitat utilization. iPlover was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center and the USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics. It is used by trained and vetted personnel to record information about habitats on coastal beaches and the environment surrounding them. iPlover uses the sensors on the smartphone to simplify and facilitate consistent data collection and data management. iPlover supports a long-established network of partners working to address ongoing impacts on plover populations, such as habitat gain or loss due to storms."
