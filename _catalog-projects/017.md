project_description: "The Local Environmental Observer Network is a project that applies traditional knowledge along side western science and technology in order to document change due to climate change, development and progress. Observations include: unusual plants and wildlife, extreme weather, erosion, flooding, droughts, wildfire and other events that can threaten food security, water security and community health. The goal is to gain better understanding about how communities are changing, to identify emerging threats, and to connect community members with topic experts who can provide assistance. The project utilizes observation reports and web-based maps to publish findings. LEO Network is based at the Center for Climate and Health at the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. It receives funding support from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency."
