project_description: "The Did You Feel It? (DYFI) project is designed to gather information available about earthquakes from the people who experience them. By tapping the immense number of users online, DYFI can get a detailed characterization of what people were experiencing, the impacts of the earthquake, and the amount of damage it incurred, beyond the scope traditional information gathering techniques. Data input from users is immediately available on the website, and its interactive platform encourages users to gain a deeper understanding of earth sciences while they participate."
