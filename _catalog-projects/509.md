project_description: The Distance Transcriber Volunteer Program at Longfellow House-Washington's Headquarters NHS increases digital access to the rich letters and journals in the park's archives. Volunteers from around the country are given access to scans of historic documents and asked to transcribe them, puzzling out 19th century handwriting. This crowd-sourcing project enables the park to increase access to the archives while reducing in-person use and potential damage to this valuable collection. Since the start of the program in March 2020, the park has signed up 25 volunteers - everyone from a family transcribing together during COVID, to teachers stuck at home.
