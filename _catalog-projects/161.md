project_description: "The goal of this BioBlitz is to identify as many species as possible in all taxonomic groups in the 100-acre NPS Coldwater Spring area. This is a follow-up to the baseline spring 2013 BioBlitz held at the site following building demo and initial site restoration in fall of 2012. The 2016 BioBlitz will be a good indication of the return of species to the site as the area is restored to a natural condition - woodland and oak savanna/prairie - and will also provide information on the return of pollinators to the area.
