project_description: "The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), National Water and Climate Center is the technical lead for the Snow Survey and Water Supply Forecasting Program, the NRCS national Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN), and a large number of water and climate activities. These include providing data for conservation, tools for assessing water supplies and climate, and resources for addressing questions on local and regional conditions, drought and climate trends. Volunteers make up a big part of data gathering at snow courses throughout the western states of Montana, Nevada, Idaho, Wyoming, and Oregon. Ranging from sites on ranches to ski resorts, citizen science volunteers donate an estimated 660+ hours per year."
