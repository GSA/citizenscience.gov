project_description: "The  Dragonfly Mercury Project  (DMP) engages citizen scientists such as students and visitors in national parks to collect dragonfly larvae from distinct sampling sites. The samples are then sent to the University of Maine, US Geological Survey, or Dartmouth College laboratories for mercury analyses. The study connects people to parks and provides baseline data to better understand the spatial distribution of mercury contamination in national parks."
