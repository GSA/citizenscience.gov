project_description: "WeDigFLPlants is a collaboration between professional research botanists, amateur naturalists, gardeners, educators, and citizen scientists to build the most complete picture possible of plant distribution and diversity in Florida over the past 200 years. The data for this historical baseline come from archived plant specimens curated by the world's 3,000 herbaria. Each of these specimens includes a label that answers the who, what, when, and where of the collecting event that produced it. Transcribing that label data into digital form and providing that data online at aggregators like idigbio.org and gbif.org makes it available to scientists, educators, natural resource managers, and policymakers addressing societal challenges today and in the future."
