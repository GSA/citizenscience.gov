project_description: "The focus is to observe and identify as many species of lichens as possible because there is relatively little information about lichen diversity at Craters of the Moon National Monument (CRMO). A 1988 air quality study at CRMO identified 30 lichens species but there has never been an actual attempt to inventory lichen diversity. Lichens are a known indicator of environmental health and an effective means of assessing environmental change."
