project_name: A New Mobile Device Application Enhances Fisherman Reporting of Alaska Groundfish Tag Recovery
project_url: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/map/alaska-groundfish-tagging-map
project_description: "The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Groundfish Tag Program of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) has released over 430,000 tagged groundfish in Alaska and West Coast waters since 1972. Tag reporting by industry is the primary means of data recovery and to date, nearly 40,000 tags have been returned by the fishing industry. It is one of the longest active tagging programs in the nation and is an example of successful cooperative research between researchers and industry, and citizen science to recover this valuable data. These tagging data are incredibly valuable and have been used to examine movement patterns, evaluate areal apportionment strategies of annual catch quota, validate ageing methods, examine growth, and have resulted in numerous scientific and management publications."  
project_topic: Animals, Ocean/water and marine
keywords: groundfish, tagging, fishing
status: Active  
recruiting: True  
agency_sponsor: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
agency_sponsor_other: National Marine Fisheries Service
geographic_scope: "Tag recoveries by fishermen occur and are reported from all federal fishery locations in Alaska, as well as internationally (Japan, Russia, Canada and Mexico)."
participant_age: 
project_goals: "We are improving and streamlining the process for industry to report data by developing a tag recovery reporting application (app) for mobile devices. A mobile app would simplify the process for fishermen when returning recovered tags and presumably could improve reporting rates and provide more tag data." 
participation_tasks: classification and tagging, data entry, geolocation, identification, measurement, observation, site selection and/or description, sepecimen/sample collection
