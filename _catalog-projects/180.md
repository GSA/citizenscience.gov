project_description: "This integrated monitoring effort gathers information associated with the Monarch population and habitat across the nation in order to help us assess the impact of threats to Monarchs, and to measure the effectiveness of conservation and management actions being taken to mitigate those threats. In order to adequately sample the monarch breeding range, this project includes potential monitoring sites distributed across federal, public, and privately administered lands. Successful completion of this effort requires a coordinated effort that includes multiple partners, non-government organizations, and the public to assist with the monitoring of key attributes about monarchs and leading factors that likely influence their population processes."
