project_description: "The Bloomington Urban Forest Research Group, at Indiana University Bloomington, evaluates the success of trees planted by nonprofit urban forestry programs, as well as the social impacts of the tree planting programs on neighborhoods. A field protocol for nonprofit organizations was developed for assessing the mortality and growth of recently-planted trees. The protocol was designed for minimally-trained volunteers or citizen scientists. Cities studied are Atlanta, GA; Indianapolis, IN; Detroit, MI; St. Louis, MO; and Philadelphia, PA. This project was funded by the USDA National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council and the US Forest Service."
