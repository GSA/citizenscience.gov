project_description: The key to successful crowdsourced bathymetry (CSB) efforts are volunteer observers who operate vessels-of-opportunity in places where nautical charts are poor or where the seafloor is changeable and hydrographic assets are not easily available. The CSB vision is to tap into the enthusiasm for mapping the ocean floor by enabling trusted mariners to easily contribute data and augment our current bathymetric coverage.
