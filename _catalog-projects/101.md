project_description: "The Federal Communication Commission’s Measuring Broadband America Program resulted from a recommendation in the National Broadband Plan to improve the availability of information for consumers about their broadband service. The FCC works with industry, academia, public interest organizations and others to develop open and transparent ways to measure broadband performance.  The FCC Speed Test App is a crowd-sourced smartphone app that measures mobile broadband performance throughout the United States. Volunteers share information about their handsets and operating systems, and the app measures the speed and performance of their broadband connection."
