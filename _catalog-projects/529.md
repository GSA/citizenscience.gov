project_name: Escaped Trash Assessment Protocol ETAP- (OW Trash Free Water Program)
project_url: https://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/best-management-practices-tools
project_description: "The EPA Trash Free Waters Program began development of this trash assessment tool spurred by external stakeholder interest.  The need from users was twofold:  standardized methodologies for sampling and analysis of trash pollution and a more effective protocol to guide source reduction decisions. The ETAP tool is designed to support data gathering on site characteristics and provide valuable information about the context of trash in the environment. The protocol can be used in various water quality protection programs operated by EPA, states and tribal governments. The ETAP materials characterization will be compatible with data cards used by other groups (e.g., Ocean Conservancy, Marine Debris Tracker App, and Litterati) so that information about trash pollution can be linked to sustainable materials management."
