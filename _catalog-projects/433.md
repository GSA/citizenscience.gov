project_description: "This event will be held at Mt. Ashland with all of our partners at the Bureau of Land Management - Oregon's Medford District, the Oregon Caves National Monument & Preserve, REI Medford, Mt. Ashland Ski Area, and Siskiyou Mountain Club. Starting at the lodge, students will hike the trail to the top of the Mt. Ashland, collecting data on iNaturalist, and will upload their observations. In the winter of 2016-2017, we'll be using the data collected to compare and contrast species diversity between seasons! This event is designed with the intent of reaching under-served kids in the Rogue and Illinois Valleys, and is part of a larger partnership formed across agency land boundaries and with other partners to encourage kids and their adults to engage in nature together. Registration is at http://www.mtashland.com/event/every-kid-in-a-park-bioblitz-2/"
