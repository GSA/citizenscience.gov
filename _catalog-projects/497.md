project_name: HiveScience | A Citizen Science Project for Beekeepers
project_url: 
project_description: HiveScience is a citizen science project, designed for beekeepers, that promotes EPA-public engagement around collecting data on hive health -- an important research issue at the local, national and international levels.  For this project, beekeepers collect data on the health status of honey bee hives, submit a sample of honey for laboratory analysis for biomarkers of honey bee immune response, and provide data on the overwintering fate of sampled hives using an EPA-branded mobile application.  Ultimately, these data will be used to determine if there is a correlation between biomarkers of honey bee colony health and actual colony overwintering performance.
