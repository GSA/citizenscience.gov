project_description: "The Wind Cave Bird Blitz focus is on migratory bird species.  This event will provide participants an opportunity to observe and identify as many bird species as possible in this 34,000 acre park.  Species as well as number of birds will be compiled.  \nThe park puts a lot of effort into tracking bird populations through Christmas Bird Counts, Raptor Surveys and Breeding Bird Surveys but has not made a formal effort to document migrant bird species in the springtime."
