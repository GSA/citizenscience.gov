project_description: "Lantern live (v1.0.4) is a mobile application (app) released by the Department of Energy (DOE). The app was created following Hurricane Sandy, when the energy department identified the need to provide real time information on energy during crises. DOE considers Lantern Live a pilot project, designed to investigate the potential for citizen science and crowdsourcing while informing best practices for government app development. Lantern Liveâ€™s code will be open source, allowing external innovators to iterate on the current technology to take advantage of the opportunities that open government and open data support."
