project_name: Aquatic Insect Monitoring in Grand Canyon
project_url: https://www.usgs.gov/centers/sbsc/science/citizen-science-light-trapping-grand-canyon
project_description: "The goal of this project is monitoring the health of the Colorado River ecosystem and its response to flow management from dams, particularly Glen Canyon Dam. Since 2012, our group has been collaborating with Grand Canyon river guides, private boaters, educational groups, and other citizen scientists to deploy light traps that collect adult aquatic insects, which are used by USGS scientists to understand how dam operations affect ecosystem health. Our results demonstrate that the abundance and diversity of aquatic insects in the Colorado River is constrained by hydropower production at Glen Canyon Dam, which informed the design of experimental Bug Flows that have been released from Glen Canyon Dam in 2018 to 2020 to try to improve the health of the Colorado River ecosystem."
