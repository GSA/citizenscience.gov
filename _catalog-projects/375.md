project_description: "This research will focus on a new framework called BACKBOnE (Building A Crowdsourced Knowledge Base of Extreme Events) for extreme event damage assessment utilizing remotely sensed images that automatically finds and classifies damages, and builds a data-driven knowledge base of damage characteristics that can be reused during future events. BACKBOnE is a transformation of the manual crowdsourced approach for damage assessment and is unprecedented in the disasters community, combining the power of crowdsourcing with state-of-the-art methods from computer science and image processing."
