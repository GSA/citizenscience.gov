project_description: "The Kelly Warm Spring Citizen Science Project seeks to gather data on the presence of invasive fish species and disease on native fish populations within Grand Teton National Park. In partnership with Teton Science Schools, the NPS conducts the monitoring program with Teton County 5th Graders. Students solidify science literacy concepts by completing the scientific data collection process, and also analyze and present their findings to their peers. Collected data is then used by the Science and Resource Management Division of the park."
