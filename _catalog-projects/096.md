intended_outcomes_other: " iCoast enhances USGS prediction models of coastal erosion to better inform emergency managers, coastal planners, and coastal residents of coastal vulnerabilities in their region. iCoast can also be used to educate the public and particularly coastal residents about coastal vulnerabilities from extreme erosion during storms. iCoast can also be used by marine science educators to further science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education."
participation_tasks_other: "Volunteers are asked to compare pre- and post-storm aerial photographs and identify coastal changes using predefined keyword tags. By classifying certain coastal features, volunteers are asked to interpret the storm-hazard process and the impacts to the natural and built environment."
types_volunteers: "A range of experts and thegeneral public. Volunteers are asked to self-identify their experience and type based on if they are coastal and marine students or scientists, coastal managers and planners, coastal residents, digital crisis volunteers, or other."

project_description: "The iCoast - Did the Coast Change? web application asks volunteers to identify changes to the coast by comparing and tagging aerial photographs taken before and after storms. Your contributions help USGS scientists improve the accuracy of USGS coastal change prediction models and vulnerability assessments that support pre-storm planning and post-storm rescue, recovery, and mitigation efforts. It is also a great educational tool for teaching students and even coastal residents about coastal hazards."
