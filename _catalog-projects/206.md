project_description: "The Wrangell Ranger District assisted the Alaska Department of Fish & Game with recruiting and organizing volunteers to participate in a bat citizen science project. The project involved volunteers performing bimonthly acoustic driving surveys of bats with bat detectors during the summer months. The District also received Tongass Diversity Grant funding to purchase equipment to be used to develop a bat research project with the local schools. The National Forest received an  EduBat  Trunk and its resources were shared with District employees working with the public."
