project_description: "Bird banding is a universal and indispensable technique for studying the movement, survival and behavior of birds. The North American Bird Banding Program is jointly administered by the United States Geological Survey and the Canadian Wildlife Service. Their respective banding offices have similar functions and policies and use the same bands, reporting forms and data formats. Joint coordination of the program dates back to 1923. For many years, bandings were reported on paper schedules. The Bird Banding Laboratory has approximately 1.5 million schedules in storage. BBL is having volunteers scan and label bird banding reports to digitize these historical records."
