project_description: "Sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is a key cultural and ecological resource in northeastern North America. Maple syrup production has been expanding across the region, despite predictions that sugar maple may be particularly sensitive to climate change. Given these trends, projections of the direct impacts of climate change on maple syrup production are needed to guide regional stakeholders to adapt to future climate variability. This study examines the effects of climate variation on sugar maple quality. Our primary goal is to provide quantitative data on how sugar maple syrup quality is vulnerable to changing climate conditions."
