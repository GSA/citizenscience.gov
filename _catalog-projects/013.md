project_description: "The Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis Project at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology develops algorithms and a system to automatically respond to natural disaster events and rapidly produce decision support information, using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Global Positioning System (GPS), and seismic data.  The ARIA Damage Validation Project combines change detection maps derived from SAR data and optical data using human brains through a mobile-friendly web interface. The crowdsourcing produces improved versions of damage detection maps decreasing the number of false positives."
