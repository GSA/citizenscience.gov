The BioBlitz is also coordinated with the Parkway's Wildlife Weekend where we will offer a wildlife education program and exhibits from partner groups for the public. Experts on taxa will lead walks with public visitors to collect as many species are available and document data in iNaturalist. The BioBlitz is a event that is conducted in partnership with Mississippi State University and the Geographic Alliance of Mississippi."
