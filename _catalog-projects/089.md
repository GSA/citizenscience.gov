project_description: "The Mobile App Marine Debris Tracker is a joint partnership of the NOAA Marine Debris Division and the Southeast Atlantic Marine Debris Initiative (SEA-MDI), located within the College of Engineering at the University of Georgia.  A primary goal of SEA-MDI is to use innovative technologies and unique expertise to add culturally relevant outreach tools and information to the current NOAA Marine Debris Division. Marine Debris Tracker is the first product of this initiative. It is our hope that it will spread awareness of marine debris, as well as serve as an easy to use and simple tool for marine debris data collection."
