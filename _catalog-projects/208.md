project_description: "Craig and Thorne Bay Ranger District personal partnered with Sitka Conservation Society, National Forest Foundation, Alaska Department of Fish and Game, and the University of Alaska to work with students to conduct habitat restoration monitoring in Twelvemile Creek, using the Stream Team curriculum, a statewide citizen science initiative that brings students out of the classroom and into the field to collect real research and monitoring data for scientists. Several teachers attended a day long training to learn the protocols for Stream Team monitoring.  Students from Hydaburg, Craig and Klawock participated in one of two field days where they collected data while working alongside researchers. This project helps students developing their math and science skills while learning about forest management, salmon habitat, and restoration efforts on the Tongass National Forest. In addition, four students were selected for internships. Interns worked long days with fisheries professionals to learn hands on fisheries sampling skills. They learned how to cross and work in swift streams, net and handle live juvenile fish, measure the length and weight of fish, take scale samples, record data, sleep and stay in a remote field camp, and work as members of a team. The interns were also offered a scholarship to attend classes for a fisheries technician certificate from University of Alaska Southeast."
