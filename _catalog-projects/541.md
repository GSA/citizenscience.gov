project_name: "Demonstration of Air Sensor Loan Programs for Rural Communities and Living/Nature Museums"
project_url: https://www.epa.gov/air-sensor-toolbox/air-sensor-loan-programs#r5
project_description: "This innovative project in the Midwest is helping the public better understand the impacts of air pollution in smaller communities and will provide information on how people can reduce their exposures to certain types of air pollution, such as particulate matter. This Air Sensor Loan Project demonstrates educational and equipment loan programs in a small number of remote Midwestern libraries and an educational/library program found at a living museum. The project has four components, including 1) virtual training for library and educational program staff on basic information about air pollution, health impacts, low-cost air monitoring sensors; 2) information on how data from low-cost sensors compare with the data from more expensive air monitoring equipment; 3) resource materials about air pollution and measurement with low cost sensors specifically designed for community members who use these smaller libraries and a living museum; and 4) low cost monitoring equipment that can be used in an air sensor loan program and in educational programs. This project is active and in progress with libraries & The Morton Arboretum actively loaning equipment."

project_goals: "This project aims to provide smaller, rural community libraries and similar organizations (i.e., living museums) an innovative hands-on way to educate community members about air pollution. With the support of trained library and resource staff, the public can use these monitoring technologies to learn about local air quality."
