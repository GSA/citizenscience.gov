project_description: "Since 1995, volunteer citizen scientists following standardized protocols (the Pollard Count Method) have surveyed butterflies living in Rocky Mountain National Park. This survey takes place for 20 consecutive weeks, from May 1st to September 17th. This survey is designed to take inventory of sensitive species to gather valuable baseline data to inform management decisions, and can also answer research questions on topics including the relationship between butterfly populations and extreme heat. Between 1995 and 2011, the number of butterfly species observed in Rocky Mountain National Park increased by 50%."
