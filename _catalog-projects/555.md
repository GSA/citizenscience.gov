project_description: "There is currently not a nationwide beach grain size database, which limits large-scale coastal studies. SandSnap is a research initiative to amass a nationwide beach sand grain size database with the help of citizen scientists taking photos of the beach sand with their smart phones. This grain size information will be used by researchers and local officials to learn more about coastal dynamics and make better management decisions."
