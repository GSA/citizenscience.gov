project_description: "Plains to the Park is a scientific research program hosted by Westview Middle School in partnership with the CDRLC and the Estes Institute. The 2014 Summer STEM Academy at the middle school participated in this program. Students and teachers worked with CDRLC staff to practice collecting data in Horseshoe Park in Rocky Mountain National Park. These middle school citizen scientists used standardized protocols as they conducted research. In addition to citizen scientist crews, students participated in a film course over the summer to document their time in the park. Their film, Plains to the Park, showcases how the students connected with the park and field research methods, and addresses the importance of citizen science."
