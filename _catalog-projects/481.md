project_description: "NOAA Fisheries Steller sea lion biologists need your help. We have hundreds of thousands of images taken by cameras stationed in the remote Aleutian Islands in Alaska. We need your help to find out which images have sea lions present with readable markings to help save this endangered population. These are the highest priority images that biologists need to review to figure out why this part of the population continues to decline. Please join us and enjoy amazing pictures of sea lions and the remote islands of wild Alaska!"
