project_description: "EPA conducted three day-long workshops in California to educate and train local watershed managers, citizen scientists, environmental justice organizations and tribal members on the new EPA- Sanitary Survey App.  This was a collaborative outreach effort with the California State Water Resources Control Board’s Clean Water Team within California Regional Water Quality Control Boards 4, 5, and 8 and onsite co-sponsorship with local and tribal organizations, including the Inland Empire WaterKeeper, Heal the Bay and the Big Valley Rancheria of Pomo Indians. <br><br> At each workshop, EPA and the California SWRCB  demonstrated the utility of the app to local watershed managers, citizen scientists, environmental justice organizations and tribal members. In addition to classroom training, participants performed hands-on training. The Marine Sanitary Survey App was developed by the U.S. EPA and is based on the marine beach sanitary survey form. This app provides a technically sound and consistent approach to identify pollution sources and share information (e.g., water quality data, pollutant source data, and land use data) to improve water quality for swimming and other primary contact recreation activities.\n"
