participation_tasks_other: "Observers conduct frog call surveys on assigned routes using an established monitoring protocol."
types_volunteers: "Volunteers must be willing to learn the survey protocols and how to identify frogs and toad by their calls. Some states require volunteers to attend a training session. Each volunteer selects an available roadside route with 10 listening stops. The volunteer surveys the route several times per year, generally in the spring through summer. Volunteers are asked to participate for at least 3 years. Volunteers need access to a computer with internet access and ability to play Real Media sound files in order to meet the quiz requirement (a Real Media player can be downloaded for free from the Real Media website). Volunteers may be asked to supply themselves with basic equipment, such as a thermometer to record air temperature. Also, volunteers need a licensed motorized vehicle and valid driver's license with the ability to drive at night (or commitment of a co-volunteer to drive). If you are under 18 years of age, check with your state coordinator on whether you may participate."

project_description: "Purpose of the project is to assess population change for frogs and toads.  Citizen scientists learn to identify their local frogs and toads by their unique breeding vocalizations and then conduct frog call surveys at predetermined locations (adopt a survey route). Data are collected using a calling survey technique, in which volunteers identify local amphibian species by their unique breeding vocalizations or calls."
