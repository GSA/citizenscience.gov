project_name: Equipment loan program for water quality monitoring
project_url: https://www.epa.gov/participatory-science
project_description: "Since 2015, the EPA Region 2 Participatory Science Water Monitoring Equipment Loan Program has provided access to field and laboratory equipment to volunteer monitoring organizations, participatory science groups, nongovernment organizations, academic institutions, local governments, Tribal Nations, and other organizations. The available equipment includes instruments for measuring water quality parameters (YSI multimeter sondes), pathogen monitoring (IDEXX testing for bacteria: Enterococcus, fecal coliform, total coliform and E. Coli), and microplastic collection (manta trawl â€“ boat required) along with handheld GPS units and turbidity tubes. Organizations that participate receive hands-on training from EPA regional staff. All recipients must submit a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) before receiving their equipment, provide monthly updates, and submit a final report that summarizes the work and outcomes of the data collection. This program is open to participatory scientist organizations in New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands and nine Tribal Nations. Priority is given to sites within communities with environmental justice issues and new applicants. The program runs annually in New York and New Jersey to reflect the general sampling season (May-November). Beginning in 2018, to accommodate more communities, the program began working with the Caribbean Science Consortium to set up a formal system of Equipment Loan Centers with university partners throughout Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. There are currently seven centers in Puerto Rico and two in the US Virgin Islands, each with their own full set of equipment maintained by university staff. This project requests applications annually in February/March for NY and NJ and on a rolling basis in Puerto Rico and the USVI."
