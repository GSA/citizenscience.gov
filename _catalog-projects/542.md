project_name: Equipment loan program for water quality monitoring
project_url: 
project_description: "Since 2015, the EPA Region 2 Citizen Science Water Monitoring Equipment Loan Program has provided access to field and laboratory equipment to volunteer monitoring organizations, citizen science groups, nongovernment organizations, academic institutions, local governments, Tribal Nations, and other organizations. The available equipment includes instruments for measuring water quality parameters, pathogen monitoring, and microplastic collection. Organizations that participate receive hands-on training from EPA regional staff. All recipients must submit a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) before receiving their equipment, provide monthly updates, and submit a final report that summarizes the work and outcomes of the data collection. This program is open to citizen scientist organizations in New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands and nine Tribal Nations. Priority is given to sites within communities with environmental justice issues and Tribal Nations. The program runs annually in New York and New Jersey to reflect the general sampling season (May-November). Beginning in 2018, to accommodate more communities, the program began working with the Caribbean Science Consortium to set up a formal system of Equipment Loan Centers with university partners throughout Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. There are currently five centers in Puerto Rico and two in the US Virgin Islands, each with their own full set of equipment maintained by university staff."
