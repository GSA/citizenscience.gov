project_description: "The Intertidal Monitoring Partnership started in 2008 as a meeting among several disparate entities with one common interest – reversing the decline of opihi (limpets) and other rocky shoreline inhabitants while promoting their sustainable harvest.  The partnership has grown into an unprecedentedly successful collaboration between Hawaiian practitioners, university scientists, and several management agencies.  For the past 8 years, community groups throughout the Main Hawaiian Islands have been actively engaged in their respective communities nearshore and intertidal monitoring efforts and have partnered with NOAA to assist and participate in an annual intertidal monitoring research effort within Papahanaumokuakea.  The partnership embraces both scientific and traditional Hawaiian knowledge and support Hawaiian communities and managers in monitoring their shorelines and effecting a positive change in their marine resources."
