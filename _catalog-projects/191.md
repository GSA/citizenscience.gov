project_description: "Monitor Change is a simple and elegant visual citizen science concept developed by USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center scientist, Sam Droege, to monitor environmental and social change using iPhones, photo-stitching, and time lapse. Droege's idea has lots of applications to the type of work that ecologists, foresters, land managers, and environmental citizen groups do and provides an easy (and actually information dense) way of tracking long-term changes using volunteers using the smart phone that many carry in their pocket. The concept is broad and is meant to be applicable to any location you would like to create uniform documentation of change over long or short periods of time without having to install a permanent camera."
