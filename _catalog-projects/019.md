intended_outcomes_other: "Relay hazard information about ashfall to the National Weather Service (NWS) and Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) air quality and drinking water divisions, as well as the Alaska Department of Health for inclusion in their hazard notifications to the public"
participation_tasks_other: "The area over which ash can fall is large, and ash-fall deposits can be ephemeral. Timely access is often difficult. Locals are ideally positioned to make observations and collect samples. The two primary tasks to the public are: (1) Making observations about ashfall, including date and time of ashfall, location, and positive or negative ashfall; and (2) Sampling ashfall and sending samples to the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO). These samples help scientists understand the composition, volume, and dispersal pattern of ash from volcanoes."
types_volunteers: "General public but we only want volunteers that see ash falling during times of eruptions."

participant_age_other: "People that observe the effect of ash falling from a volcano and can share first-person accounts. AVO staff also enter reports called into the office or are emailed via the USGS website or Facebook account."

project_description: "Is Ash Falling? project is a database module and web interface allowing the public and Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) staff to enter reports of ashfall in their local area in real time and retrospectively following an eruptive event. Users browsing the AVO website during eruptions will be directed towards a web form allowing them to fill in ashfall information and submit the information to AVO. The ashfall report database will help AVO track eruption clouds and associated fallout downwind. These reports from the public will also give scientists a more complete record of the amount and duration and other conditions of ash fall. First-hand accounts of ashfall will support ashfall model development and interpretation of satellite imagery and will improve ashfall warning messages. The online form will also free up resources during exceedingly busy times during an eruption, as most individuals currently phone AVO with their reports."
