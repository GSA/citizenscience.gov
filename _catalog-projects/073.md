project_description: "The North American Bird Phenology Program is a project supported by the USGS and USA-National Phenology Network where a network of volunteers record the first arrival dates, populations, and departure dates of migratory birds across. The program was initially run from 1880 and 1970 and originally coordinated through the Federal government with support from the American Ornithologists' Union. Today it is part historic collection containing six million migration observations that help to illuminate nearly a century of migratory bird patterns and populations. The focus today has become to translate these records into an interactive database for the 21st century."
