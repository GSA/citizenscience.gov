project_description: "This application collects and displays photos of water levels.  Documenting water levels helps us to better visualize and understand changing water levels and its effects on roads, homes, and businesses.  Examples of contributions include high tides (such as king tides) and flooding events from storms.  Seeing elevated water levels will help us get a glimpse of our future with higher sea levels and will help planners and researchers protect homes, lives, and businesses."
