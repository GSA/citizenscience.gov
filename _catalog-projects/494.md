project_name: Cyanoscope - EPA collaborative partnership on monitoring harmful algal blooms
project_url: https://cyanos.org/
project_description: This program started at the request of the New England State environmental agencies and their efforts to determine how best to monitor and manage harmful algal and cyanobacteria blooms. This initial project evolved into a three-tiered program to educate people on the problem, how to monitor and provide surveillance to better understand the dynamics of harmful algal blooms (HABs), and the collection of key data to assist in determining trends, hotspots, and other important data surrounding HABs.
