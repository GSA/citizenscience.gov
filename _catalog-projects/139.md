project_description: "This will be our eighth annual BioBlitz and we will focus on birds this year in all areas of the park that are accessible. We will use the online database eBird to compile both species and location information for birds found. In addition, we will ask for photos of birds to help fill the data gap of over 80 bird species that have never been vouchered in the park."
