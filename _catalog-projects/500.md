project_description: 'Through Invader ID, help us track changes in fouling communities that settle on tiles we''ve placed around the US and look for new occurrences of invasive species. By tracking changes in these organisms through time and in different locations, we can better understand how coastal areas are changing and hopefully see early warning signs of environmental changes.'
