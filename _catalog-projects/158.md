project_description: "We are encouraging area scientists, students, and volunteers to meet us in Anaktuvuk Pass to document as many species as possible in Gates of the Arctic National Park over the course of three days. This will be a hands-on, educational experience that will help the National Park Service gather important information on species diversity at an ecologically unique location in the Brooks Range. Get involved! Help us identify and name as many species as we can in English, Latin, and Inupiaq!"
