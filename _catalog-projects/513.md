project_description: "Beginning in 2001, more than one hundred commercial fishing vessel captains have helped deploy oceanographic sensors on the Northeast Continental Shelf as part of the Environmental Monitors on Lobster Traps and Large Trawlers (eMOLT) program.  While there have been a variety of instruments deployed, bottom temperature sensors and satellite-tracked drifters have provided the most data and continue to be deployed today. As of this writing, over 50 commercial vessels have collectively  transmitted over 13,000 haul-averaged bottom temperatures in real time which are now being fed to ocean forecast models. For our fisheries to be sustained in a rapidly changing environment, it is important that the stakeholders be involved and partner with government-funded science to monitor our shelf water variability on multiple time and space scales."

project_goals: "With help from the commercial fishing industry, the Gulf of Maine Lobster Foundation in particular, we hope to collect basic physical oceanographic data that can a) improve both ocean circulation models and stock assessments and b) contribute to our local ocean observing system for decades to come."
