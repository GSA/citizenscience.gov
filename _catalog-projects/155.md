project_description: "The annual Cricket Crawl is a call to citizen scientists, artists, naturalists and scientists for an evening sound census of the late summer crickets and katydids singing throughout local areas in Washington District of Columbia (DC), Arlington (VA) and Baltimore (MD). This is a citizen science pilot project in which participants listen for the calls of crickets and katydids and document their observations. Volunteers are asked to venture out between dusk and midnight to random locales throughout the city in order to make their observations. The data from observations is then aggregated and assessed in an annual report."
