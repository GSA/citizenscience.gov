project_description: "How can we train robots to act autonomously, but also safely? We attempted to do by allowing the crowd, through the internet, to train robots, just as we do our children and our pets. This allows robots to learning not only how to perform a wide range of actions, but also to do by predicting how the crowd will respond to those actions."
