These tools include: the Lunar Mapper, which is a web-based geographic analysis system, and the Integrated Lunar Information Architecture for Decision Support application (ILIADS) which is a downloadable geospatial information program. Through the use of these tools, users can aid future mission planning and research through the manipulation and characterization of Lunar information."

project_description: "The web portals produced by the Lunar and Planetary Mapping and Modeling Project provide interactive online tools that allow anybody with an Internet connection to search, view, and analyze the immense database of  images and digital records collected from a variety instruments aboard a number of spacecraft studying a growing number of worlds. The project, which is magaged through SSERVI at NASA Ames developed at JPL, provides a platform for anyone to conduct in-depth analyses. These insights are used to support mission planning and planetary science for upcoming exploration and science missions to planetary bodies. The Lunar Mapping and Modeling Project is funded through NASA Science Mission Directorate and Human Exploration Operations Mission Directorate. The project works with NASA Challenge programs in order to engage the global software development community through contests and hackathons to come up crowdsourced solutions to develop new tools and enhance existing tools for planetary data visualization and analysis. The project is also charged to provide the public with tools that will facilitate their better understanding of and participation in the process of selecting sites for future exploration. "
