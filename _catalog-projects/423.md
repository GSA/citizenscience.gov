project_description: "Improved understanding of climate and environmental changes observed in the Arctic and worldwide demands vast amounts of currently inaccessible historical data. This program aims to recover these data—millions of weather, ocean, and sea-ice observations recorded by mariners and scientists over the past 150 years—and make them available in digital formats suitable for model assimilation, retrospective analysis (reanalysis), and other research."
