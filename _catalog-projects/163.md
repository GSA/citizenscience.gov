project_description: "As part of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Cyber Crimes Center (C3), the CEIU uses cutting edge investigative techniques to bring justice to consumers, producers and distributors of child pornography, as well as to predators engaging in child sex tourism. The efforts of the CEIU, in addition to ICEâ€™s participation in national programs like Operation Predator and international partnerships like the Virtual Global Taskforce, have resulted in the rescue of thousands of children.  The program encourages law enforcement and the public at large to report suspected child predators and suspicious activities through toll-free hot lines and a mobile phone application."
