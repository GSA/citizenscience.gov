project_description: "When you look up into the night sky, do you wonder what's out there beyond our solar system? So do we! Come join us in learning more about exoplanets, the worlds that orbit distant stars. You don't need to own a telescope in order to participate. We can give you archived data from robotic telescopes to process with our free EXOTIC software. If you do have a telescope with a tracking mount, we can show you how to observe exoplanets yourself."
