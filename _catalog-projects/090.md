project_description: "The Great Lakes Worm Watch is a project designed to increase the scientific literacy and public understanding of functions carried out by exotic species in relation to changing ecosystems. Citizens are asked to contribute to the expansion of a database characterizing the distributions of exotic earthworms and their impacts to the region. Gear and training are provided by the project for educators, the hope is to build an understanding of the methods of scientific research concerning exotic earthworms and in turn create a more comprehensive understanding of forest ecosystems ecology. Support for the Great Lakes Worm Watch project has been provided by the NSF, the Coastal Zone Management Act (NOAA), Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund, Boulder Lake Environmental learning Center, The Natural Resources Research Institute, the Northeast Regional Sustainable Development Partnership and the University of Minnesota."
