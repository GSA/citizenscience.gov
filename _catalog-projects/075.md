project_description: "The S'COOL Project involves people (ages 5-99) in real science, taking and reporting ground truth observations of clouds to assist in the validation of NASA's Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments. CERES  is an important tool for scientists who study how atmospheric moisture affects our weather and climate. The observations made by S'COOL help to provide another piece of the puzzle. The project, which began in 1997, is coordinated with satellites that carry CERES instruments as well as geostationary weather satellites. S'COOL was developed from the beginning in coordination with teachers who sought a safe, simple and cheap way to unite students with NASA. In 2008 technology advances enabled S'COOL to accept observations from citizen scientists anywhere in the world. Since 2016, S'COOL is integrated with GLOBE cloud observations, but still accepts observations directly from non-GLOBE countries. GLOBE countries submit their cloud observations through NASA GLOBE Clouds - https://www.globe.gov/web/s-cool."
