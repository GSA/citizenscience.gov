project_description: "IDAH2O is an innovative program to train citizen volunteers about regional water quality issues. Once a volunteer becomes a certified Master Water Steward, they then adopt a stream location to conduct regular monitoring on. Monitoring includes habitat, biological, chemical and physical assessments. All data collected from the Stewards is uploaded to a website that is made publicly available. The main focus of the program is to educate citizens on the status of their water quality and to help them understand the effects on streams, rivers and lakes. Youth involvement is also strongly encouraged. The data that is collected may also someday assist agencies in establishing water quality standards and priorities. IDAH2O lists financial support from the US Department of Fish and Wildlife and the EPA Environmental Education."
