project_description: "A closely coordinated laboratory and astronomical study will be undertaken to identify the seeds of dust formation in three prototypical astronomical objects: a carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star, and an oxygen-rich red supergiant and M-type AGB star.  By measuring the rotational spectra of new complex inorganic molecules — i.e., those beyond the previously known simple diatomic and triatomic molecules — radio astronomers using ALMA will be able to begin unveiling the chemistry in the inner envelopes of late type stars which are a major source of planet forming dust."
