project_description: "Citizen scientists are collecting coastal water samples and filtering them to look for the presence of microplastics (using a microscope). They are also helping to educate stakeholders about the sources of and problems caused by microplastics in order to encourage people to read labels to avoid purchasing plastics when non-plastic alternatives are available, and to recycle/reuse as much as possible."
