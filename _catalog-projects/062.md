intended_outcomes_other: "Regulation and Decision making support - The survey's data are routinely used to identify at-risk bird species and inform avian conservation planning."
participation_tasks_other: "Volunteers are asked to perform annual bird counts at pre-established locations during the height of the breeding season in order to monitor changes in population abundance. Volunteers use standardized, scientifically rigorous counting procedures. Each summer more than 2,000 skilled participants conduct point-counts at over 150,000 locations."
types_volunteers: "This project seeks individuals with excellent hearing who have the demonstrated ability to identify all locally occurring birds by both sound and sight. New BBS participants must also successfully complete the BBS Methodology Training Program before their data will be used in any BBS analyses. "
