project_description: "The Battle of the Atlantic Research and Expedition Group (BAREG) is a 501(c)(3) educational non-profit organization located in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington DC.  The Group is focused on historical research of topics related to the maritime campaigns waged between the Allies and Axis/Central Powers during 1914-18 and 1939-45, diving wrecks associated with these campaigns, and documenting their current conditions via photography and/or videography. BAREG divers work closely with a continuing partnership with maritime archaeologists from NOAA's Monitor National Marine Sanctuary."
