project_description: "Together, we will learn about and practice rainwater harvesting to irrigate home and community gardens. Arizona community members have recognized the benefits of harvesting rainwater. However, there is a lack of information regarding the quality of harvested water and there are no monitoring programs. You will be collecting environmental samples from residential, school, and/or community gardens irrigated by harvested rainwater to monitor the quality of harvested rainwater, soil, and plants. By participating in Project Harvest, you will be trained in the scientific method and you will learn how to measure bacteria, organic, and inorganic contaminants in samples alongside our team of environmental scientists over a three-year period. Together, we will co-generate a dataset that will not only inform guidelines and recommendations for safe, harvested rainwater use on gardens, it will support communities to safely and sustainably produce their own foods."
