project_description: "Neighborhood Nestwatch is a citizen science program that uses face-to-face interaction on an annual basis to teach citizens about the wild birds and the process of science in their own backyards. Participants are mentored to collect data which examine the impact of urbanization on wildlife. What makes Neighborhood Nestwatch so effective and scientifically robust is the face-to-face interaction between many participants and Smithsonian scientists when we visit their backyards to band birds and find nests every spring. Neighborhood Nestwatch provides both a powerful educational experience and a unique platform for important scientific research."
