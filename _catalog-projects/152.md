participation_tasks_other: "Volunteers can participate by using their personal computer as a seismologic instrument via a USB plug-in or by using the accelerometer in a laptop or smart phone. Data is then analyzed by software during and after an event before being uploaded on a central server."
types_volunteers: "We are particularly interesed in volunteers in education (formal and informal). Volunteers will need to request a sensor or have a supported laptop or smartphone with an internal sensor."

project_description: "The QCN is a project that enables seismologic recordings by tapping into the vast network of computing of personal computers, laptops, and smart phones. Volunteers can connect small USB seismic sensors to their computers or use sensors internal to laptops or smart phones to record earthquakes. Data is then collected by a software application that sends seismograms back to a central server. The volunteers can then log in and see what earthquakes they have recorded through the project website."
