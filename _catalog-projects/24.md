project_description: "The NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) is collecting public weather reports through a free app available for smart phones or mobile devices. The app is called mPING for Meteorological Phenomena identification Near the Ground. Weather radars cannot access data at the ground, so mPING reports are used by the NOAA National Weather Service to fine-tune their forecasts. NSSL uses the data in a variety of ways, including to develop new radar and forecasting technologies and techniques."
