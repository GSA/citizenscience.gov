project_description: "Visitors can become community scientists by taking photographs at five photo monitoring locations in the park and submitting them to a web-based system called Chronolog. In return, the visitor receives an e-mail with a description and a time lapse video of the restoration work, human or climate related change being monitored at that location. The photographs help the park and its partners monitor and share the story of landscape change as a result of these actions."
