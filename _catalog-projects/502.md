project_url: https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/rcb/projects/gopro-aquaculture/
project_description: 'The goal of this project is to document how oyster cages used in shellfish aquaculture provide habitat, and determine whether that habitat is similar or different from habitat provided by naturally occurring rock reef environments. The NOAA Fisheries Milford Lab is doing this in Long Island Sound, and we''ve created a Citizen Science Guide that shellfish growers and the general public can use to make their own videos: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/noaa-fisheries-lab-helps-shellfish-growers-become-citizen-scientists'
