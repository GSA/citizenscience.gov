project_description: "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is partnering with the San Diego Museum of Natural History, University of California at San Diego and the U.S. Forest Service to organize and work alongside citizen scientists in the Big Bear and Lake Arrowhead communities in the San Bernardino Mountains to study an insular population of  flying squirrels.  Our objective is to develop habitat models that will permit mangers to compare occupancy rates between the developed and undeveloped areas of the forest.  Citizen scientists will be deploying motion sensitive cameras and bait stations at various locations to monitor the presence/absence of flying squirrels.  Citizen scientists are responsible for the establishment, maintenance and data management of individual stations (sample points)."
