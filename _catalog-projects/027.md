This information is entered into an online web form or mobile app. The time commitment to become an observer is roughly ten minutes. Observation takes about two minutes for each organism once volunteers are familiar with the protocols."

project_description: "Nature's Notebook gathers information on plant and animal phenology across the U.S. to be used for decision-making on local, national and global scales to ensure the continued vitality of our environment. Scientists alone cannot collect enough data: They need your help. Join more than 6,000 other amateur naturalists across the nation in taking the pulse of our planet. Volunteers use scientifically-vetted observation guidelines, developed for over 1,000 species, to ensure data are useful to researchers and decision-makers."
