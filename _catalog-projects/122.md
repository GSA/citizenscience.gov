project_description: "iSeeChange is an unprecedented national climate reporting project that uniquely combines citizen science, using public media to reach people and cutting edge wx data collection methods. Built as a crowdsourced wx almanac for a national user base, iSeeChange also connects to radio audiences on climate related issues in their daily work and play through their stories. The project will build a citizen science corps by giving participants a chance to report from their own experiences and opportunities to connect to experts. User generated reports include text, photos, and stories.  NASA will be a key partner in the next phase by providing SIF and CO2 data for user generated observations of related phenomena on the ground."
