participation_tasks_other: "Users can report nonindigenous and invasive aquatic species they sight, automatically receive email alerts, or perform searches on aquatic species. The system is flexible, providing two different perspectives: one to a user interested in an area; the other to users interested in a species. Whether the user chooses automatic alerts or prefers to search the site is up to them."
