project_description: "Detailed exploration case studies, such as Beaumont and Foster (1990, 1991, 1992), which were completed for oil and gas plays, will give operators an accessible portal for gathering clean, unbiased information with which to explore for geothermal drilling prospects.  Providing a database of these case studies with each case study broken down into queriable properties makes this information even more powerful in planning future exploration efforts in new areas.\nThe goal of this effort is to develop a template for geothermal case studies in a crowd-sourced platform to allow for contributions from the entire geothermal community. Information collected for the case studies includes historical information regarding exploration and development in an area and current information about reservoir characteristics and facility production. The initial focus is on populating case studies for developing and operational geothermal areas throughout the world that can then be used as a basis for discovering new areas, and guiding efficient exploration and development of those areas."
