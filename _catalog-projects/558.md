project_name: Are we alone in the universe?
project_url: http://arewealone.earth
project_description: "Help us answer one of scienceâ€™s most important questions. The UCLA SETI Group uses the largest fully steerable telescope on Earth to search for evidence of civilizations in our Galaxy. We observe thousands of stars and their planets with the goal of detecting radio transmissions. You will classify signals by matching them to common classes of radio frequency interference. Your classifications will be used to develop artificial intelligence tools to accelerate the search."
