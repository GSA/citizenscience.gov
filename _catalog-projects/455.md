project_description: "Rock Creek's forest makes an ideal summer home — with Food,  shelter, and ideal nesting sites — for the wood thrush, a songbird. But climate change and other factors could end this long relationship. Rising temperatures disrupt the seasonal patterns of plants and animals. What will happen in these woods? We need your help to find out. Take photos on the picture post and help us record changes."
