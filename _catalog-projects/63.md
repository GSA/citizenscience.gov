project_description: "Citizen Archivist is a project run through the National Archives and Records Administration that crowdsources contributions such as tags and transcripts of digital images in NARA's database. These contributions are designed to increase public access to the records of the Federal Government by helping organize, describe and classify its vast historical records. There are more than 10 billion pages of paper records stored in digital files, and of that vast quantity only a small percentage have been labeled, translated or cataloged. The project is designed to support the White House's Open Government Directive and employs an open-source editing style much like that of Wikipedia. The title \"Citizen Archivist\" was invented by David Ferriero, who is the 10th Archivist of the United States, to describe how the National Archives can harness the public in order to contribute to the organization of records.
