project_description: "Gulf Islands National Seashore will work with resource experts and partners to lead Bioblitz inventories of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in varied locations throughout the park. The Bioblitz event will focus on specific species and critical habitat areas rather than an all-taxa inventory to best serve the resource stewardship goals of the park and inform management decisions. Additionally, educational hands-on activities and booths will enhance the event and foster stewardship and learning for participants and the greater community."
