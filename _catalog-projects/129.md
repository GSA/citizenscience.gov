(2) Text the station number and the stream stage to the phone number listed on the gage.  (3) Stream stage is then added to our database and is published for public use on the CrowdHydrology web page.  (4) Researchers, Students, Outdoors people, Resource managers, etc. can then use these data free of charge.  (5) Pat yourself on the back because you are Citizen scientist, and we could not have done this without your help."

project_description: "The CrowdHydrology mission is to create freely available data on stream stage in a simple and inexpensive way. We do this through the use of crowdsourcing, which means we gather information on stream stage or water levels from anyone willing to send us a text message of the water levels at their local stream to collect spatially distributed hydrologic data. These data are then available for anyone to then use, from Universities to Elementary schools, interested in studying hydrologic data."
