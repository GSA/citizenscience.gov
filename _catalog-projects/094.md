project_description: "Specially trained citizen scientists with NOAA Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and National Park - volunteers use sightings forms and the Spotter Pro app to record and upload current marine mammal sightings in the Santa Barbara Channel and in sanctuary and park waters. Observations include weather, behavior and presence absence information for sightings. Serves as an important resource for the West Coast Region Sanctuaries Whale Aware collaborative that works to track whales near shipping lanes where they are at risk of ship strikes and provides long-term photo-ID of blue and humpback whales as well as general patterns of cetacean distribution in this part of the Southern CA Bight."
