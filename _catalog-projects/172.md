project_description: "Operation Dragon Fire (ODF) bridges the gap between data overload and meaningful and actionable information. As a clearinghouse or data marketplace for disaster_response, ODF will provide a means to identify, aggregate, validate, and analyze data from multiple sources, and access to applicable information via multiple channels. With ODF, participating entities, including government at all levels, non-profits, response organizations, first responders, private sector industry, corporations, technology platforms, and the public can make faster, smarter decisions, with information provided by a preferred and trusted source. ODF strives to create an environment where unified, timely, and reliable information is available before, during, and after emergencies. ODF will serve as a data conduit, connecting the public and private sectors, to encourage information sharing, coordination, and collaboration across the response community. Project kickoff was in June 2014."
