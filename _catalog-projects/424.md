project_description: "The public helped document what birds are using the park at different elevations during a fun, science-filled weekend. There is no cost for this event. The Bird BioBlitz was a part of the NPS Centennial Celebration, as we support learning about biodiversity in our national parks. The BioBlitz included bird walks, talks, activities, and demonstrations. We concentrated on four main areas: Birding: Learn about the world of birding in the remote Great Basin Bird Science: Learn about the science used in ornithology Bird Conservation: Learn how we apply bird science and bird observations to real-life issues Bird Photography: Take photos of birds in the park to serve as vouchers (definitive proof that they exist in the park). Over 80 species need to be vouchered."
