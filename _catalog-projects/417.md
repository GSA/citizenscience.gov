project_description: "Supported by the National Science Foundation, Water for Life (WfL) builds communities’ water literacy while improving their access to high quality drinking water. Organized and run through Pacific Resources for Education and Learning, and coordinated by professional educators, environmentalists, and water systems staff in Chuuk, Yap, Palau, and the Marshall Islands, WfL melds engaging and relevant informal science education with powerful professional and community service learning components.  Core Teams in each site prioritize, plan, implement, and evaluate projects such as renovating rainwater catchment systems, improving groundwater and surface water sources, creating educational materials, and engaging community members in monitoring and maintaining quality of drinking water sources."
