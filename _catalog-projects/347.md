project_description: "There are an estimated two billion specimens housed in natural history museums around the world. These biological collections document where species and populations exist now and where they existed decades and centuries before, so they hold irreplaceable information necessary for uncovering important patterns. This project enables anyone on the internet to contribute to this effort and we hope that they gain knowledge of biodiversity during the process."
