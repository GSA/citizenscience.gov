Haynes, Dr.PH., and Kim Anderson, Ph.D., researchers at the University of Cincinnati (UC) College of Medicine and Oregon State University (OSU) received funding from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) to study air quality before, during, and after unconventional natural gas drilling (UNGD), or fracking, activity.\r\r\nThe purpose of this study is to find out if the air quality in a community changes during UNGD activities. The research is being conducted in Carroll County, and neighboring counties, in Ohio."
