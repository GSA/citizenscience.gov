participation_tasks_other: "Scientists, students and teachers can participate through collecting and contributing data of local environmental relevance to the GLOBE database. Student observations focus on five key areas of earth science: atmosphere, hydrology, terrestrial biology, and soil science. Teachers are responsible for showing students how to collect, measure and record observations according to proper scientific method. Scientists play an integral role in supporting volunteer activities by developing protocols and analyzing data. "
types_volunteers: "In addition to school-based participation, GLOBE recruits alumni to support implementation in respective countries. Beginning in 2016, GLOBE also recruits individual citizens for participation either in a campaign mode or in sustained observations."

project_description: "GLOBE, the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program, is a worldwide program that brings together students, teachers, scientists and citizens to promote science and learning about the environment.  Through a hands-on approach to inquiry, participants are encouraged to engage in local investigations that cover five core fields: atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, soil (pedosphere), and Earth as a system. Observations made locally are submitted to the GLOBE data and information system, and can be accessed freely online. These measurements are combined with readings at automated stations to create a worldwide resource for conducting scientific inquiry; some measurements serve as ground truth for NASA satellite data products (e.g., clouds, soil moisture).  The GLOBE data and information system contains over 145 million measurements from more than 10 million students in 119 countries around the world since its operation begun in 1995. Beginning in 2016, GLOBE expanded its participation outside of the formal school setting to include individual citizens of all ages through the GLOBE Observer mobile app."
