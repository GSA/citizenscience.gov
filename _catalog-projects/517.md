project_name: Great Smoky Mountains National Park Species SnapIt and MapIt
project_url: https://dlia.org/snapit-mapit
project_description: "The Species SnapIt & MapIt project empowers visitors to Great Smoky Mountains National Park to record and report valuable information about the animals, plants and other organisms they see in the park. Participants are encouraged to look for certain under-studied species in the park and to share their observations using an app called iNaturalist. Their observations are used to develop new species distribution maps for a public NPS web tool called Atlas of the Smokies. This tool allows users to visualize where a species has been found across the park and see where else it is likely to occur, based on a number of environmental factors. Park officials use these maps to make informed land management decisions, while researchers use them to better understand the spatial distribution of life across the Smokies."
