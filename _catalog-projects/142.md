project_description: "Join John Muir National Historic Site to help identify as many species as possible in specific taxonomic groups, particularly rare species; to gain information about species for which we have little information about in the park (e.g. invertebrates, fungi, mosses, etc.); to quantify areas of invasive species persistence and pervasiveness; and inventory species that are indicator species (e.g. lichen)."
