project_description: "SciCast is a crowd-sourced prediction market for science and technology. Users upload questions and provide input on a variety of topics related to science and technology that can be used to inform policy decisions. The market is based on the principle that the crowd can more accurately predict trends than individuals. From a research perspective the platform provides insights into the fields of combinatorics, Bayesian networks, Markov engines, and advanced recommender systems."
