participation_tasks_other: "Participation in the Phytoplankton Monitoring Network begins with series of training sessions aimed at equipping volunteers with the tools necessary to take consistent accurate readings.  While anyone is encouraged to participate, from school groups to master naturalists, volunteers must have access to a microscope and commit to sampling once every two weeks throughout the year.  Typically, the sampling process takes minutes to complete, while analysis and reporting can take up to an hour. Data then becomes accessible on the master database."

project_description: "The Phytoplankton Monitoring Network (PMN) is a community-based network of volunteers that assist NOAA scientists in monitoring marine and freshwater phytoplankton and harmful algal blooms (HABs). The program was created by NOAA’s National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) in 2001. Since its inception, PMN has grown to include more than 600 volunteers across 36 U.S. states and territories.

PMN uses trained volunteers to collect samples, identify different species of phytoplankton using digital microscopy, and report their data to NOAA scientists using an online database. NOAA uses this information to support HAB forecasts and assist state and tribal managers in mitigating the effects of HABs.

More recently, PMN has established a new program – Aquaculture PMN (AQPMN) – focused on providing aquaculture farmers and fish hatcheries with the tools to monitor for phytoplankton known to reduce growth or kill shellfish and finfish species. This data will help provide farms with advance warning of high levels of dangerous phytoplankton and minimize economic losses to the aquaculture industry."
