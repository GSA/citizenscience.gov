participation_tasks_other: "Participation in the Phytoplankton Monitoring Network begins with series of training sessions aimed at equipping volunteers with the tools necessary to take consistent accurate readings.  While anyone is encouraged to participate, from school groups to master naturalists, volunteers must have access to a microscope and commit to sampling once every two weeks throughout the year.  Typically, the sampling process takes minutes to complete, while analysis and reporting can take up to an hour. Data then becomes accessible on the master database."

project_description: "The Phytoplankton Monitoring Network (PMN) project was created by the National Centers for Costal Ocean Science (NCCOS) of NOAA in order better recording of harmful algal blooms and marine phytoplankton populations. PMN uses trained volunteers to help maintain and monitor a costal survey area throughout the year. The monitoring activities include: characterizing the populations of phytoplankton, tracking harmful algal blooms, support Marine researchers in mitigating the effects of harmful algal blooms and help increase public awareness of the effects and consequences of alagal blooms and phytoplankton populations. The origins of the PMN date back to 2001 when the NOAA Marine Biotoxins Program began an outreach project to monitor marine phytoplankton in collaboration with the South Carolina Task Group on Harmful Algae. Since its inception, the PMN has helped characterize more than 250 algal blooms helping NOAAâ€™s Biotoxin program better understand the process that lead to harmful algal blooms. More recently the PMN has spread the length of the Atlantic coast, the Gulf Coast and to the Pacific."
