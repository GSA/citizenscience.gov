During the 8-week study period, which takes place annually in April and May, volunteers partner with experienced researchers to collect and analyze migrating eels at specified locations. At the end of the study period, data is collected and analyzed by scientists to aid insight into the health of the Hudson River watershed."

project_description: "The Hudson River Eel Project is a survey style study of the American Eel during its 8-week spring migration from the Atlantic Ocean into the Hudson River watershed.  During the survey, volunteers collect information regarding the juvenile eel population by capturing them using fyke nets and weighing them before releasing them upstream. These methods are in accordance with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, which oversees sampling standards.  Because of the American Eel’s sensitivity to environmental change, the data collected can then be used by scientists as a bioindicator for the overall health of the watershed.  Furthermore, the project encourages engagement between volunteers, scientist and local community members over the sustainable management of environmental resources. The Hudson River Eel Project is supported through NOAA’s National Estuarine Research Reserve System and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation"
