intended_outcomes_other: "The Indigenous Observation Network (ION) is the largest international, Indigenous initiative combining Indigenous Knowledge and western science to research, sustain and protect the Yukon River Watershed, its resources and cultures."
participation_tasks_other: "Volunteers collect water quality samples at established sites on the Yukon river. These volunteers are trained to collect data using QA protocols developed in collaboration with USGS. Data collected includes physical measures of pH, water temperature, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen, along with chemical water analysis of major anions, cations, DOC, water gases and isotopes. Physical data and observation records are kept on field sheets and sent along with water samples to YRITWC staff, and later shared with a USGS lab in Boulder, Colorado. "

project_description: "The Indigenous Observation Network (ION) is a collaborative research and monitoring project to preserve and protect the Yukon River for future generations and the continuation of a traditional Native way of life. Since 2006, the USGS National Research Program and Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council (YRITWC) have been partnering to collect water-quality samples from the Yukon River and tributaries with the assistance of trained Indigenous citizens living in the Yukon River Basin. Through this partnership over 300 Indigenous citizens have been trained in water sample collection, which has resulted in over 1500 samples collected at more than 54 sites covering the entire 2,300 mile reach of the Yukon River since the program began. In addition to water-quality monitoring a permafrost monitoring project began in 2009 called the Active Layer Network. This project measures the thickness of the active layer on an annual basis and collects air and soil temperature readings as well as soil moisture measurements at 20 locations across the Yukon River Basin and Alaska and Canada. Note: Volunteers must be trusted local citizens that are recommended by Tribal Councils, Newsletter, YRITWC outreach. "
