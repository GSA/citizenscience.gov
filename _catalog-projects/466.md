project_description: "Detroit is working to restore it's tree canopy.  Citizen foresters play an essential role in this as volunteers are responsible for leading groups of up to 20 volunteers on planting days.  Citizen Foresters demonstrate best practices for planting a tree and are quality control supervisors and motivational leaders during our tree planting events in the spring and fall, supporting the Greening of Detroit in their inventory of the plantings available at https://www.opentreemap.org/thegreeningofdetroitstreemap/map/"
