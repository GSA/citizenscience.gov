## About the Catalog
This database provides a government-wide listing of citizen science and crowdsourcing projects by agency. 

It is designed to improve cross-agency collaboration, reveal opportunities for new and high-impact projects, and make it easier for volunteers to find projects in which they can participate. Projects submitted to the catalog are validated for agency involvement by federal employees.
