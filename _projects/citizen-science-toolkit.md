## About the Toolkit
The Federal Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Toolkit, released in September 2015, provides five basic process steps for planning, designing and carrying out a crowdsourcing or citizen science project to help federal employees use crowdsourcing and citizen science to advance the missions of their agencies.

The toolkit also provides case studies, models, and other resources, including success stories and some of the challenges that developers faced in designing and carrying out citizen science and crowdsourcing projects. The case studies can serve as models for federal employees inspired to carry out their own projects. 

The toolkit was developed with the support and collaboration of more than 25 federal agencies in collaboration with OSTP, the Federal Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Community of Practice (CCS), and GSAâ€™s Open Opportunities Program.
