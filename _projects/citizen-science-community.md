## Welcome to Our Community!
#### There are two primary groups within the federal government working to advance crowdsourcing and citizen science use and practice. These are:

The [Federal Community of Practice for Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science](https://www.digitalgov.gov/communities/crowdsourcing-and-citizen-science/) is a grassroots community open to all federal practitioners working on, funding, or just interested in learning more about crowdsourcing and citizen science.

[Agency Citizen Science and Crowdsourcing Coordinators]( {{ site.baseurl }}/agency-community/) are a group of federal employees designated by their agency leaders to be responsible for implementing tasks to advance crowdsourcing and citizen science.

If you have questions, please email citizenscience@gsa.gov.
