## Welcome to Our Community!
#### There are groups within the federal government working to advance crowdsourcing and citizen science use and practice. These are:

<div markdown="1" class="community-about">
The [Federal Community of Practice for Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science](https://digital.gov/communities/crowdsourcing-citizen-science/) is a grassroots community open to all federal practitioners working on, funding, or just interested in learning more about crowdsourcing and citizen science. To join the listserv, email FCPCCS-subscribe-request@listserv.gsa.gov with subscribe FCPCCS in the subject and enter your name + agency you work for.

[Agency Citizen Science and Crowdsourcing Coordinators]( {{ site.baseurl }}/agency-community/) are a group of federal employees designated by their agency leaders to be responsible for implementing tasks to advance crowdsourcing and citizen science.

The [Federal Crowdsourcing Webinar Series](https://digital.gov/event/2020/02/11/federal-crowdsourcing-webinar-series-episode-7/) explores how federal agencies are engaging the crowd to multiply the ideas and perspectives they bring to certain issues.

If you have questions, please email citizenscience@gsa.gov.
