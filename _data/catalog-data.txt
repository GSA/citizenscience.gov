project_description: "Populations of many migratory birds that require large tracts of mature forest to nest are declining across the eastern states, despite the fact that our forests are maturing and in many states are stable or increasing in area. birds provide vital ecological functions in forests, including pest control and seed dispersal, so continued declines in bird populations may negatively affect forest health and regeneration. Reversing these declines requires an understanding of the habitat needs of forest birds throughout their life cycle. This research focuses specifically on the 1-2 month period between nesting and migration, a period of the life cycle which isn't well studied. \nThis is a formal study which involves a dedicated group of citizen scientists. there is also an associated outreach and education program, which is held through the Jamestown, NY Audubon Society for five Saturdays every spring, beginning the last Saturday in April. I am combining these two projects for the purpose of this database. The larger outreach and education project allows more informal opportunities for citizen science, and data collected through that effort is still entered in the (North American) Bird Point Count Database for scientific use."

The ashfall report database will help AVO track eruption clouds and associated fallout downwind. These reports from the public will also give scientists a more complete record of the amount and duration and other conditions of ash fall. First-hand accounts of ashfall will support ashfall model development and interpretation of satellite imagery and will improve ashfall warning messages. The online form will also free up resources during exceedingly busy times during an eruption, as most individuals currently phone AVO with their reports."

The project generates nowcast and forecast products routinely and in a pre-transitional demonstration of operational predictions of toxigenic blooms and domoic acid toxins along the central California coast by merging: 1) ecological/statistical models to 2) existing hydrodynamic model simulations (ROMS), 3) enhanced satellite imagery (MODIS-Aqua with DINEOF), 4) and community (Cal-HABMAP)/crowdsourced (JellyWatch and Marine Mammal Center) observations. Highly reliable data on marine mammal strandings from domoic acid (DA) toxicosis are provided by the Marine Mammal Center (TMMC) and serve as an important source of matchups for broad geographic attribution of the DA events. These near real-time validation data are provided by our collaboration with the JellyWatch and TempBreak communities to populate crowdsourced observations with marine mammal stranding data that serve as a proxy for offshore DA events. A close partnership has been established with NOAA’s National Ocean Service (NOS) and the National Weather Service (NWS) to test the new data product in an environment suited towards serving as the operational center."

project_description: "Aurorasaurus is the first citizen science project that aggregates relatively rare sightings of the Northern and Southern Lights in order to improve real-time tracking and understanding of the beautiful phenomenon. The Aurorasaurus project allows the public to enter their observations of aurora through their website, as well as on a mobile application platform, in order to better characterize their frequency, location, and rare visual characteristics. We also collect related tweets, map them, and ask users to help verify these as real-time sightings. During periods of high aurora activity, Aurorasaurus sees a significant uptick in public reporting of the phenomenon, allowing the project to ground truth the data being collected by other instruments, and alert registered users in real-time. Informal educational resources are offered as well. "

project_description: "Participants attend a one-day classroom and field based education program, where they learn about species identification, management concerns, and how to observe and document observations of mountain goats, bighorn sheep, and pikas. They also learn how to use field equipment such as spotting scopes, compasses, and GPS receivers. Once trained, participants select survey sites from a list of mapped locations. Hiking distances to the sites range from along the roadside up to fifteen miles each way. Mountain goat and bighorn sheep surveys consist of one hour observing the selected site with binoculars and a spotting scope. During pika surveys, participants traverse talus (boulder) fields looking under rocks for pikas, pika scat, and food caches (haypiles).\nHigh country habitats are highly vulnerable to impacts from climate change, yet, little is known about how these changes may impact high elevation wildlife. Mountain goat and pika population declines have been documented in areas outside of Glacier. The primary goal of the project is to collect baseline information about population size and distribution and to monitor population trend over time."

project_description: "Gros Ventre Project - A Cooperative Project with the U.S. Forest Service & Nature Mapping\nIn January 2009, the Bridger-Teton National Forest issued a new travel and use plan that affected road use throughout the forest including in the Gros Ventre drainage. Forest Service staff did not have the resources needed to adequately cover the monitoring needs therefore creating an ideal situation where volunteer citizen scientists could assist to collect critical information that will inform decisions and engage people in a timely and meaningful wildlife project. The spring of 2011 represented the second year of this data collection effort. The project is expected to continue through 2012 or 2015 (3-5 years total).\nProject Background\nThe Gros Ventre drainage is critically important for many wildlife species and was a primary focus during the motor vehicle planning process. The new motor vehicle designations made some significant changes in this drainage to reduce impacts on wildlife, reduce maintenance costs and improve the ability to enforce travel regulations. \nOne change was a new seasonal restriction prohibited public motor vehicle use until June 1st in the upper portion of the drainage beyond the Slate/Crystal Creek junction. This change was primarily intended to protect the native soil road surface in the upper portion of the drainage thereby reducing road maintenance costs and to benefit wildlife during the transition from winter to summer range. \nExisting data shows that the drainage is important for elk calving, pronghorn antelope migration, bighorn sheep, as well as sage grouse leks. \nThe USFS and Nature Mapping wanted to establish a baseline and gain more knowledge about how animals were distributed in the drainage during the critical spring transition from wintering to summering grounds. \nGathering this information consistently each year provides critical information on the efficacy of the seasonal restriction."

project_description: "In CrowdMag project, NOAA explore whether digital magnetometers built in modern mobile smartphones can be used as scientific instruments. With CrowdMag mobile apps, phones all around the world send magnetometer data to NOAA. At NOAA, we check quality of the magnetic data and make data available to the public as aggregate maps and charts. We have two long-term goals: 1) Create near-real-time models of Earth's time changing magnetic field by combining crowdsourced magnetic data with real-time solar wind data. and 2)   Map local magnetic noise sources (for e.g. power transformer and iron pipes) to improve accuracy of the magnetic navigation systems."

Early detection of disease events that affect wildlife is often difficult to achieve. There must be observers in the area to take note of the event, and have knowledge of what to do with that information, as well as beat scavengers to the evidence. To help address this need, the Wildlife Data Integration Network (WDIN) developed WHER. After wildlife disease events are recorded in WHER, these observations are joined with other wildlife sightings\nand are viewable in tabular reports or on a map, enabling people to see where similar events are happening."

project_description: "Global pollinator populations are in decline for a variety of reasons including habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change. The Greater Atlanta Pollinator Partnership (GAPP) was initiated in 2011 because of the rapid loss of habitat and increase in pesticide use caused by the housing boom of the 1990s and early 2000s. Over this 20-year period, approximately 400,000 acres of green space were lost.  Goals of the GAPP are to encourage restoration and development of pollinator habitat at a landscape scale that is ecologically significant; consequently, we designed our project to focus on an area within a 25 - mile radius around downtown Atlanta, Georgia. This comprises nearly 1.2 million acres of potential pollinator habitat and includes all major public lands in metropolitan Atlanta and thousands of individual residences. Within this area, efforts focus on restoring pollinator-friendly habitat and educating the public through formal and informal opportunities.  Key components of the GAPP include using native species when available, rescuing native plants from construction sites, controlling invasive species, establishing community gardens, citizen science projects, conservation, education, research, and website development.  The GAPP website (http://gapp.org/) is critical to our online garden registration and mapping so we can track garden establishment, assess habitat development trends including identifying where corridors are developing or where more effort is needed, provide online educational materials, and provide focus to the effort through a newsletter. Through the GAPP, Bombus pensylvanicus, a rare and declining species, has been documented in a community garden in downtown Atlanta.  This indicates even rare species can be conserved in urban environments if the appropriate species are planted.  Funding for the Greater Atlanta Pollinator Partnership is limited, so synergy through partnerships is the key to success."

The 2014 Summer STEM Academy at the middle school participated in this program. Students and teachers worked with CDRLC staff to practice collecting data in Horseshoe Park in Rocky Mountain National Park. These middle school citizen scientists used standardized protocols as they conducted research. In addition to citizen scientist crews, students participated in a film course over the summer to document their time in the park. Their film, Plains to the Park, showcases how the students connected with the park and field research methods, and addresses the importance of citizen science."

These contributions are designed to increase public access to the records of the Federal Government by helping organize, describe and classify its vast historical records. There are more than 10 billion pages of paper records stored in digital files, and of that vast quantity only a small percentage have been labeled, translated or cataloged. The project is designed to support the White House's Open Government Directive and employs an open-source editing style much like that of Wikipedia. The title \"Citizen Archivist\" was invented by David Ferriero, who is the 10th Archivist of the United States, to describe how the National Archives can harness the public in order to contribute to the organization of records.

Today the program has nearly 10,000 volunteers that contribute to daily measurements in a variety of locales, from urban to rural and ocean-to-ocean across the nation. The NWS supports Coop through the selection of observation locations, the recruitment and training of observers, the installation of equipment, as well as maintenance, collection and disbursement of data with the help of the National Climate Data Center. Funding for Coop began after the establishment of the Weather Bureau by Congress in 1890, therefore establishing the first network of cooperative weather stations.  Since then, volunteer weather observation has been the backbone of the United States climate data, crediting the Cooperative Network for establishing the most definitive source of weather data for the United States."

project_description: "Citizen Scientists are trained to identify five invasive plants and map their locations in Glacier National Park. Citizen Scientists can be trained by attending the park’s annual Weed Blitz, held each year in July, or by downloading and viewing a PowerPoint presentation. The Weed Blitz is an all-day event where volunteers attend a training presentation in the morning from Glacier National Park’s Invasive Plant Management Program, and in the afternoon, volunteers separate into groups to search for and pull invasive plants. \nOnce trained, Citizen Scientists conduct surveys along Glacier National Park’s 700+ miles of hiking trails from June to September to determine the distribution and extent of the five targeted invasive species within the park. Species targeted by the program are Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea stoebe), Oxeye Daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare), Houndstongue, (Cynoglossum officinale), St. Johnswort (Hypericum perforatum) and Yellow Toadflax (Linaria vulgaris).\nThe Invasive Plant Citizen Science Project provides valuable data to the Invasive Plant Management Program in Glacier National Park. Volunteers map and report populations of invasive species which might otherwise have gone undetected, giving the park an opportunity to control them before they spread further."

project_description: "The American Woodcock Singing-Ground Survey, conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, exploits the conspicuous courtship display of the male woodcock. The survey consists of numerous routes in the eastern half of the U.S. and Canada, which are surveyed in the spring. Counts of singing male woodcock along the routes provide an index to woodcock abundance, and are used to estimate woodcock population trends for states, provinces, management regions, and the continent. The survey is the major source of information considered in the annual setting of woodcock hunting seasons. The Singing-ground survey, in its present form, began in 1968 and has continued once a year to present day. There are approximately 1,500 Singing-ground Survey routes randomly placed throughout the heart of the woodcock breeding range in Canada and the United States. These routes were placed across the landscape, covering all habitat types. It is one of three surveys used to monitor woodcock population status in North America and it provides managers with an index to the relative woodcock population size. The survey takes advantage of the conspicuous breeding call of male American woodcock that can best be described as a “peent.”"

PMN uses trained volunteers to help maintain and monitor a costal survey area throughout the year. The monitoring activities include: characterizing the populations of phytoplankton, tracking harmful algal blooms, support Marine researchers in mitigating the effects of harmful algal blooms and help increase public awareness of the effects and consequences of alagal blooms and phytoplankton populations. The origins of the PMN date back to 2001 when the NOAA Marine Biotoxins Program began an outreach project to monitor marine phytoplankton in collaboration with the South Carolina Task Group on Harmful Algae. Since its inception, the PMN has helped characterize more than 250 algal blooms helping NOAA’s Biotoxin program better understand the process that lead to harmful algal blooms. More recently the PMN has spread the length of the Atlantic coast, the Gulf Coast and to the Pacific."

Funded in part by grants through the USDA Small Business Innovation Research program, OpenTreeMap encourages community groups, non-profit organizations, governments, and local citizens to work together to map and explore the urban forest. Members of the public can search the existing tree data by species and other search filters, add new trees, edit existing tree data, upload images, or leave comments. OpenTreeMap uses the i-Tree software developed by the US Forest Service to calculate and display the ecosystem benefits generated by urban trees, and members of the Forest Service have reviewed the project. OpenTreeMap is available as open source software or a subscription service, and there are over twenty OpenTreeMap sites available worldwide."

project_description: "This classroom project helps high school teachers meet national education requirements  and students learn about mosquitoes, public health, and safety.  One of the main goals of the project is to transform teachers and students into citizen scientists.  The Invasive Mosquito Project provides educational materials for teachers and students.  As part of data gathering, students collect mosquito eggs around their houses.  After a week, upon the presence of eggs, students bring the mosquito eggs to class and choose to raise ¼ of the eggs to adults following the protocol and safety measures provided in the lesson plan. The remaining eggs are sent to USDA.  Classes have the opportunity to assess local, regional and national mosquito distribution data and to determine if there is an increased risk of particular pathogens in their community based on the presence of certain mosquito vector species.  In addition to the public education component, another goal of the IMP project is to monitor invasive mosquito species in the United States.  The project uses a new partnered approach to citizen science given each classroom is paired with mosquito and public health professionals that support the lesson plans and data gathering by, for instance, confirming the students’ mosquito identifications."

Since 2006, the USGS National Research Program and Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council (YRITWC) have been partnering to collect water-quality samples from the Yukon River and tributaries with the assistance of trained Indigenous citizens living in the Yukon River Basin. Through this partnership over 300 Indigenous citizens have been trained in water sample collection, which has resulted in over 1500 samples collected at more than 54 sites covering the entire 2,300 mile reach of the Yukon River since the program began. In addition to water-quality monitoring a permafrost monitoring project began in 2009 called the Active Layer Network. This project measures the thickness of the active layer on an annual basis and collects air and soil temperature readings as well as soil moisture measurements at 20 locations across the Yukon River Basin and Alaska and Canada.\nNote: Volunteers must be trusted local citizens that are recommended by Tribal Councils, Newsletter, YRITWC outreach.

project_description: "Quantifying coastal habitat utilization with smartphones! Understanding and managing dynamic coastal landscapes for beach-dependent species requires biological and geological data across the range of relevant environments and habitats. It is difficult to acquire such data; many data collections focus on either the biology or the geology, are collected by non-specialists, and lack observational uniformity. iPlover is an app that addresses these difficulties, and simplifies and facilitates consistent data collection, management, and enables direct data input into research models of habitat utilization. iPlover was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center and the USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics. It is used by trained and vetted personnel to record information about habitats on coastal beaches and the environment surrounding them. iPlover uses the sensors on the smartphone to simplify and facilitate consistent data collection and data management. iPlover supports a long-established network of partners working to address ongoing impacts on plover populations, such as habitat gain or loss due to storms."

project_description: "Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS), funded by a grant from NOAA’s Marine Debris Program, initiated shoreline debris monitoring in 2012 following NOAA’s Marine Debris Shoreline Survey Field Guide methods published in 2012.  OCNMS volunteers originally initiated shoreline debris monitoring in 2001 using data categories standardized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Ocean Conservancy.  Heightened interest in shoreline debris data associated with concerns about materials originating from the March 2011 Japan tsunami coincided with release of the new NOAA methods, which prompted significant modification of OCNMS’ shoreline debris monitoring program.  \nShoreline debris data will be used to document temporal, spatial, and composition patterns in debris deposition on Washington’s coastline, and to the extent possible to identify changes in debris types and volumes associated with the March 2011 tsunami debris.  \nIn 2012, new shoreline debris monitoring methods were initiated at 6 sites on the outer coast of Washington state.  By 2014 there were nine coast sites and seven sites on the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  The goal for FY 2015 is to continue this monitoring effort and expand the effort to teachers and their students within walking distance of coast sites."

It has since grown into a collaborative effort of over 700 local and national organizations all volunteering together to establish community and school gardens across the country. The simple act of planting a garden can help unite neighborhoods in a common effort and inspire voluntary, locally-led solutions to challenges facing our country - from hunger to the environment. The majority of garden construction, maintenance, harvest, data gathering, information sharing, is done by volunteer students, teachers and master gardeners. They've built over 2000 gardens, volunteered 222,000 hours and harvested over 3.9 million pounds of produce donated to local food banks."

project_description: "Citizen scientists are trained to conduct surveys at 45 lakes with suitable habitat in Glacier National Park.  Surveys are used to document presence of common loons and observations of breeding and nesting behaviors. Citizen Scientists attend a one-day classroom and field based education program, where they learn about species identification, behavior, management concerns, and how to observe and document loons. They also learn how to use field equipment such as spotting scopes, compasses, and GPS receivers. Hiking distances to the sites range from along the roadside up to fifteen miles each way. Once they reach the lake, Citizen Scientists observe for one hour and document loon sightings and behavior.\nCommon Loons are a Montana Species of Special Concern, and Glacier National Park harbors about 20 percent of Montana’s breeding pairs. Loons are susceptible to adverse impacts by human disturbance at nest and nursery sites. The Common Loon Citizen Science Project helps to identify factors that affect nesting success. The contribution of citizen scientists to the long-term record of loon population health is invaluable in providing a scientific basis for management recommendations, especially in regards to issues that may affect loon nesting success and habitat."

project_description: "Adopt a Pixel is a citizen science program that engages the public in collecting data, in this case landscape photographs, for scientific research. The science community has easy access to Landsat satellite data but has limited resources for acquiring ground reference photographs to verify land cover type. The goal of Adopt a Pixel is to acquire ground-based photographs to improve satellite data interpretation for operational and research science. Photographs from volunteers provide scientists with ground-based landscape data that would be too expensive or time consuming to acquire by other means. You can adopt a Landsat pixel by taking photographs of it that will help scientists interpret data from the new Landsat satellite. We want you to take a series of landscape photographs and make a few simple observations. Volunteers can share their land cover photographs and participate in the program by visiting the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center Adopt a Pixel interface (adoptapixel.cr.usgs.gov). Images show the terrain from a single point facing North, South, East, West, Up, and Down to give a clear view of landscape features in all directions. Field observations include land cover classification and any notable comments about conditions, patterns, or changes."

These measurements improve our ability to make rapid post-earthquake assessments of expected damage and contribute to the continuing development of engineering standards for construction. To accomplish this, we developed a new type of digital seismograph that communicates its data to the USGS via the internet. The seismographs connect to a local network via WiFi and use existing broadband connections to transmit data after an earthquake. The instruments are designed to be installed in private homes, businesses, public buildings, and schools with an existing broadband connection to the internet. The NetQuakes seismographs access the internet via a wireless router connected to your existing broadband internet connection. The seismograph transmits data only after earthquakes greater than magnitude 3 and otherwise does not consume significant bandwidth."

project_description: "Invasive weedy plants are a widespread problem throughout the United States. Their growth is often widely dispersed, with little scientific ability to predict why they occur in a given location. In addition, historical human activities such as urbanization, agriculture, and forestry have a marked effect on the distribution and spread of invasives. This integrated project will quantify relationships of weed distribution and spread with land use, then use that information directly in educating agriculture stakeholders, natural resources managers, and other interested parties on potential human-induced opportunities for invasive species spread. The Invasive Plant Atlas of the MidSouth (IPAMS) will provide information on the biology, distribution, and best management practices for forty weedy plant species. Outreach and extension activities include developing training programs for volunteers to identify and report invasive species using IPAMS, developing an efficient Early Detection and Rapid Response (EDRR) system for invasive plants, developing best management practices workshops, and developing an online mapping system. Research activities include conducting systematic regional vegetation surveys to assess the distribution of key invasive plants, developing models for predicting the occurrence of target species based on land use and cover, and evaluating the relative effectiveness of professional versus volunteer surveys."

SEANET was initiated by the Tufts Center for Conservation Medicine, in collaboration with the Lloyd Center for Environmental Studies in Massachusetts, during Autumn 2002. Since this time, the project has expanded to beaches throughout New England, New York and New Jersey and more recently, to the southeastern US, with beaches in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. SEANET volunteers conduct year-round beached bird surveys in order to identify and record information about bird mortality along the east coast of the United States. Data collected by hundreds of SEANET volunteers are used to examine the spatial pattern of bird carcass deposition and how it varies across time. These surveys provide baseline information about bird mortality and can help to detect mass mortality events due to oil spills, algal toxins, and disease outbreaks. Marine birds can serve as indicators of ecosystem and human health; monitoring the threats they face and their mortality patterns can teach us about the health of the marine environment."

Studying insect emergence can lead to fundamental insights about the life history of insects, for example by identifying the specific times of year when emergence occurs. The number of insects emerging from a river is a function of larval population abundance in a river, so quantifying insect emergence might also be a useful proxy for standard benthic monitoring of insects; benthic monitoring in Grand Canyon is extremely challenging because of swift currents, deep water, and daily hydropeaking. In 2012 we started collaborating with commercial river guides (http://www.gcrg.org/) and Grand Canyon Youth (http://www.gcyouth.org/) to quantify insect emergence throughout the 240 mile long segment of the Colorado River in Marble and Grand Canyon.  Each night in camp, guides put out a simple light trap to collect flying insects.  After one hour, the light was turned off, the sample poured into a collection bottle, and some notes were recorded in a field book. After the conclusion of the river trip, guides dropped off samples and field notes at our office and we processed the samples in the laboratory."

The project is hosted by the Butterfly and Moth Information Network and is directed by Kelly Lotts and Thomas Naberhaus. In 1995, a team of scientists at the USGS Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center (NPWRC) conceived and developed two sites: Butterflies of the U.S. and Moths of the U.S. The mission, in part, of Northern Prairie's Grassland Ecosystem Initiative was to work with others to assess the biotic resources of the Great Plains, to facilitate information sharing among agencies, organizations, and individuals, and to synthesize that information. The BAMONA project is based upon work previously supported by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) Program from 2004-2011."

project_description: "The Dolphin & Whale 911 app will enhance accurate and timely reporting of stranded marine mammals in the Southeastern U.S.\nNOAA Fisheries is faced with numerous challenges to enhance the protection, conservation, and management of marine mammals. One of the main challenges is the lack of public awareness about how to report stranded marine mammals. When the public is unaware of how to contact their local Stranding Network, response can be delayed, compromising the animal’s chance of survival and/or limiting the amount of valuable data collected from dead animals. By providing valuable information on smartphones, including a colorful species identification guide, the public will know who to call and what to do when they find a sick, injured or dead marine mammal, thus contributing to marine mammal conservation."

Every year, landslides cost the nation 1 to 2 billion dollars in damage. Falling rocks, mud, and debris flows are one of the most common and sometimes deadly hazards faced by all U.S. citizens, yet there is still a lot we do not know about how and why they happen. Now, scientists at the USGS are asking the public to help them track landslides to better understand how to protect lives and property. "

project_description: "The overarching goal of this study is to examine how science can be conducted in a real-world manner (i.e., at ranch-level scales with manager involvement) to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive grazing management for both production and conservation goals.  In particular, we seek to examine how grazing management can be implemented in a manner that responds to current and changing rangeland conditions, incorporates active learning, and makes decisions based on quantitative, repeatable measurements collected at multiple spatial and temporal scales. To this end, ARS scientists and university collaborators have developed an adaptive grazing management experiment being implemented at the Central Plains Experimental Range in northeastern Colorado.  A Stakeholder Group of 10 persons was selected to represent ranchers, public land managers, conservation organizations and nongovernmental organizations.  This Stakeholder Group met in September of 2012 and January and September of 2013 to 1) choose and prioritize outcomes desired from this experiment, 2) determine criteria and/or triggers for movement of livestock among pastures in an adaptive manner, and 3) select appropriate monitoring data requirements needed for feedback to determine if management is achieving desired outcomes."

project_description: "Craig and Thorne Bay Ranger District personal partnered with Sitka Conservation Society, National Forest Foundation, Alaska Department of Fish and Game, and the University of Alaska to work with students to conduct habitat restoration monitoring in Twelvemile Creek, using the Stream Team curriculum, a statewide citizen science initiative that brings students out of the classroom and into the field to collect real research and monitoring data for scientists. Several teachers attended a day long training to learn the protocols for Stream Team monitoring.  Students from Hydaburg, Craig and Klawock participated in one of two field days where they collected data while working alongside researchers. This project helps students developing their math and science skills while learning about forest management, salmon habitat, and restoration efforts on the Tongass National Forest.\r\r\nIn addition, four students were selected for internships. Interns worked long days with fisheries professionals to learn hands on fisheries sampling skills. They learned how to cross and work in swift streams, net and handle live juvenile fish, measure the length and weight of fish, take scale samples, record data, sleep and stay in a remote field camp, and work as members of a team. The interns were also offered a scholarship to attend classes for a fisheries technician certificate from University of Alaska Southeast."

During the survey, volunteers collect information regarding the juvenile eel population by capturing them using fyke nets and weighing them before releasing them upstream. These methods are in accordance with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, which oversees sampling standards.  Because of the American Eel’s sensitivity to environmental change, the data collected can then be used by scientist as a bioindicator for the overall health of the watershed.  Furthermore, the project encourages engagement between volunteers, scientist and local community members over the sustainable management of environmental resources. The Hudson River Eel Project is supported through NOAA’s National Estuarine Research Reserve System and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation"

project_description: "Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, in collaboration with Mass Audubon, is expanding their study of seabirds in the sanctuary. Our goals are threefold: to systematically collect baseline data on seabirds within sanctuary boundaries to compare populations over time; to educate the public about seabirds and connect residents with their sanctuary; and to train a group of observers to join our scientists in this groundbreaking project.  The resulting data will be used to compare relative abundance of seabirds over time--to help us understand populations within the sanctuary and their possible impacts on local ecosystems and as a barometer for other changes in the environment.\nStaff and volunteers of Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary conduct an annual National Audubon Christmas Bird Count (CBC) with Mass Audubon each year, following a scientific protocol to track bird populations and behavior for a day. However, in order to truly understand these birds, we need to track them more often at home at sea.  Mass Audubon has advised that, in addition to the CBC, we move toward at least five cruises per year on the Auk, plus regular trips on vessels of opportunity.  Our valued volunteers can help us achieve this goal and help us communicate the status and importance of seabirds to the public."

project_description: "The West Coast collaboration was conceived by the five national marine sanctuaries of the West Coast, Conserve.IO, and Point Blue Conservation Science, in coordination with the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), to reduce the number of ship collisions with whales. West Coast national marine sanctuaries encompass 12,843 square miles of marine protected areas around the Channel Islands, Cordell Bank, Greater Farallones, Monterey Bay and Olympic Coast. Sanctuaries use a multi-pronged approach to reducing the risk of whale ship strikes and have committed to activities in research and monitoring, policy and management collaborations, and education and outreach. To learn about new and continuing initiatives led by West Coast sanctuaries and partners, visit the sanctuary website dedicated to reducing ship strike risk to whales. Sanctuaries are host to numerous threatened and endangered whale species such as blue, humpback, fin, sperm, and western North Pacific gray whales among others. These migratory whales rely on the highly productive waters located in the West Coast sanctuaries supplied by the California Current System."

project_description: "Many communities are faced with exposure to environmental stressors, associated health risks and limited understanding of environmental language to articulate their concerns. Through the Regional Sustainable Environmental Science (RESES) research program, EPA Region 10 is partnering with communities across the Pacific Northwest to address this reality. This project introduces academic institutions, community based organizations and state and local government to the EPA’s Community Focused Exposure and Risk Screening Tool. C-FERST is a web based, environmental information and GIS mapping tool that acts as a resource for communities to identify, understand and assess potential risk and exposure at the local level. By beta testing C-FERST in community based participatory research projects, community members take on the role of scientists; conducting community assessments, developing data collection mechanisms for field research and ground truthing to link remote data with local knowledge. Community and agency data are incorporated through simple, user generated GIS layers, photographs and ‘map notes’ on C-FERST. The project is modeled using academic institutions as a hub to engage underserved communities including youth of color, houseless populations and school-age children. Their environmental concerns range from brownfields and community livability and children’s health and asthma along the I-5 corridor in Portland, OR to urban environmental education and just and healthy food systems in Tacoma, WA. This research is supported by the EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) Sustainable and Healthy Communities (SHC) program."

project_description: "Since 1995, volunteer citizen scientists following standardized protocols (the Pollard Count Method) have surveyed butterflies living in Rocky Mountain National Park. This survey takes place for 20 consecutive weeks, from May 1st to September 17th. This survey is designed to take inventory of sensitive species to gather valuable baseline data to inform management decisions, and can also answer research questions on topics including the relationship between butterfly populations and extreme heat. Between 1995 and 2011, the number of butterfly species observed in Rocky Mountain National Park increased by 50%."

project_description: "The Midwinter Bald Eagle Survey takes place during the first two weeks of January each year. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) coordinates the Midwinter Bald Eagle Survey, in which several hundred individuals count eagles along standard, non-overlapping survey routes. Nationwide counts of eagles were coordinated by the National Wildlife Federation from 1979 until 1992, when the Bureau of Land Management's Raptor Research and Technical Assistance Center assumed responsibility for overseeing the count.  Responsibility for count coordination shifted to the National Biological Survey (1993-1996) and later to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center, Snake River Field Station.  In April 2007, the USGS established a partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to maintain the long-term, national coordination of the survey, data analysis, and reporting. USACE will assume responsibility for coordinating the national survey, organizing the results, maintaining the long-term database, and jointly compiling, analyzing, and reporting survey data gathered with USGS following previously used methods (Steenhof et al. 2002) in 2010 and 2015."

Providing a database of these case studies with each case study broken down into queriable properties makes this information even more powerful in planning future exploration efforts in new areas.\nThe goal of this effort is to develop a template for geothermal case studies in a crowd-sourced platform to allow for contributions from the entire geothermal community. Information collected for the case studies includes historical information regarding exploration and development in an area and current information about reservoir characteristics and facility production. The initial focus is on populating case studies for developing and operational geothermal areas throughout the world that can then be used as a basis for discovering new areas, and guiding efficient exploration and development of those areas."

project_description: "The Coastal observation And Seabird Survey Team (COASST) is a citizen-science program established to identify the carcasses of marine birds found on beaches along the coast of the Pacific Northwest. COASST is a project of the University of Washington in partnership with state, tribal and federal agencies, environmental organizations, and community groups along the coasts of Oregon, Washington and Alaska.  COASST believes citizens of coastal communities are essential scientific partners in monitoring marine ecosystem health.  By collaborating with citizens, natural resource management agencies and environmental organizations, COASST works to translate long-term monitoring into effective marine conservation solutions.\nSpecifically, trained COASST volunteers conduct surveys for beached birds on the same stretch of coastline each month.  Each bird carcass is measured, identified, photographed, marked, and left in place for potential re-find on subsequent surveys.  Beach morphology, visitors use and presence or absence oil is also recorded.\nCOASST data have created a baseline, or the 'normal' pattern, for beached bird mortality. Armed with this information, we can detect unusual events such as increased mortality due to low food availability, weather, harmful algal blooms, oil spills, or other factors. \nPerhaps most importantly, COASST data can be used to identify long-term changes in the status of our resident marine bird populations."

The project is based off of an open contribution platform that allows users and providers to voluntarily add information about the use of photovoltaic systems. The database provides a real-time snapshot of the current state of photovoltaic usage because it is actively updated by contributions from users. \nOpen PV also provides the web application \"\"installations Over Time,\"\" which allow users to map specific fields of PV coverage as well as their expansion over time. The project was created by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), which seeded the baseline database through contributions from utility providers and state- run incentive programs. Because of the open source contribution architecture, NREL monitors contributions to the database in order to maintain the validity of the project."

project_description: "This is an EPA Region 10 ‘Making a Visible Difference’ (MVD) in/NE Portland, OR project. The objective of this project is to leverage existing partnerships between EPA Region 10 and communities in/NE Portland, Oregon. The aim is to engage academia, local community members, government and health partners to consider their voices in developing transit and neighborhood scenarios for school children’s bus routes and bus stop. The project focuses particularly on pollution sources, reduction and potential mitigation measures. This research allows for citizen science activities and the use of a suite of EPA tools such as:  EJ Screen (the public version to provide a first look at mapping community issues); C-FERST (the pre-development version, to provide detailed environmental and community characterization and assessment); C-LINE (a modeling and visualization system for traffic related air pollutant exposure) and other EPA science tools such as EnviroAtlas (for community environmental modeling). The vision for this project is to make a visible difference with citizen science such that it becomes a bridge for the community to independently uncover links and solutions to local environmental concerns."

In 2015, EPA provided additional support by lending four air quality sensors to help with monitoring efforts. \nThis program allows ICC to address key areas of concern—for example, by conducing monitoring with the goal reducing childhood asthma, which affects 25% of school children in greater Newark. For EPA this is a proof of concept program, created to study the effectiveness of citizen science equipment lending before implementing similar program and other communities."

project_description: "SKYWARN® is a National Weather Service (NWS) program developed in the 1960s that consists of trained weather spotters who provide reports of severe and hazardous weather to help meteorologists and emergency managers make life-saving warning decisions. There are well over 300,000 active SKYWARN Weather Spotters in the U.S. Spotters are concerned citizens, amateur radio operators, truck drivers, mariners, airplane pilots, emergency management personnel, and public safety officials who volunteer their time and energy to report on hazardous weather impacting their community. \nThe first steps in becoming an official NWS SKYWARN Weather Spotter is to complete training on weather hazards and their reporting in your area. Classroom type training is typically offered each Spring and Fall. To find the next available training provided by your local NWS forecast office please visit this interactive map: http://www.nws.noaa.gov/skywarn/skywarn.htm\nIn partnership with the COMET® Program, which is part of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research's Community Programs supplemental national web-based training was also created. For more information please visit: https://www.meted.ucar.edu/training_course.php?id=23"

project_description: "Balancing sustainable ecological and economic objectives is a continuing challenge for fisheries managers. Many US fisheries harvest healthy target stocks, however, bycatch of non-target species is common, and can result in large-scale fishery closures. Technological advancements in remote sensing over the past decade have revolutionized the way fishermen target ocean resources and the amount of data available on the ocean environment. In partnership with the California drift gillnet fishery and National Marine Fisheries Service, we aim to use these data to balance protection of ecological resources and economic viability. The objective of this Feasibility Study Project is to evaluate the applicability of EcoCatch, a near real-time, multi-species fisheries management tool. Our approach will build on previous NASA-funded projects, TurtleWatch and WhaleWatch, that couple spatial data of protected species with remotely-sensed data to successfully reduce bycatch and other human impacts. We will use remotely sensed satellite oceanographic, fisheries and satellite tracking data to produce near-real time spatial models of target catch and bycatch, assimilating additional information from fishermen input. Our objective is to develop a predictive tool that will enhance conservation of protected and non-target species, while maintaining sustainability and profitability of the fishery."

Each volunteer selects an available roadside route with 10 listening stops. The volunteer surveys the route several times per year, generally in the spring through summer. Volunteers are asked to participate for at least 3 years. Volunteers need access to a computer with internet access and ability to play Real Media sound files in order to meet the quiz requirement (a Real Media player can be downloaded for free from the Real Media website). Volunteers may be asked to supply themselves with basic equipment, such as a thermometer to record air temperature. Also, volunteers need a licensed motorized vehicle and valid driver's license with the ability to drive at night (or commitment of a co-volunteer to drive). If you are under 18 years of age, check with your state coordinator on whether you may participate."

project_description: "ScienceCache is a geocaching mobile app that connects the public to places where scientists have questions.  Anyone can navigate to a site, take pictures and answer questions posed by scientists about plants, animals, water, or geology.  The data is then uploaded to a project database where the scientist can access it.   The pilot project on huckleberries and their pollinators will begin in Glacier National Park summer of 2016.  One goal of this framework is to allow 'easy entry' for scientists into public data collection and outreach.  Scientists use a website to set up routes, including 1 or more sites with the location coordinates, hints and photos to help people find the location, the questions to ask and descriptions of how to answer the questions.  The initial version will work on iphones. Features of the app include the ability to work outside of cellular service. Funding and development of the app is a partnership between computer scientists at the Fort Collins Science Center, research ecologist, Dr. Tabitha Graves, and the Community for Data Integration.  "

project_description: "Tweet Earthquake Dispatch uses social networks to support earthquake response and report information about related hazards. Through the TED system, the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Earthquake Information Center analyzes data from social networks to detect earthquakes within seconds of their occurrence. TED harvests real-time tweets through a continuous connection to Twitter. The system applies a query parameter to reduce the stream to tweets that contain the keyword earthquake in several languages. For each tweet filtered by keyword, TED archives the creation time and text, the Twitter user location, the Twitter tweet ID, and the time the tweet appeared in the TED database. Around the clock, TED also ingests seismically derived earthquake information from the USGS’s near-real-time internal global earthquake stream. TED archives the earthquake time, region, magnitude and hypocenter (latitude, longitude and depth). It also records the source of the scientifically derived earthquake information. TED detects two to three earthquakes a day, on average. Especially in regions with few seismometers, TED reports often come in before traditional seismic networks detect an earthquake, giving seismologists early warning. TED sometimes detects earthquakes entirely missed by USGS’s automatic processing system, thereby increasing the number of felt events known to the agency. In addition, the tweet text and attached images sometimes offer a rapid qualitative assessment of an earthquake’s impact."

The program is part of Dr. Beth Middleton's project to compare the role of purple loosestrife in its native and invasive habitats. Purple loosestrife is native to Eurasia but invaded northern North America after accidental introduction in the 1800s. This species may be reducing the value of infested wetlands for wildlife, although this claim is debated. The results of the study will help in efforts to control and predict the future spread of this species. Growing numbers of people are volunteering to help in Australia, Canada, Turkey, and the United States. The data measurements include documenting details about your site location, measuring the height and numbers of loosestrife, and making a few environmental observations."

project_description: "Learning to See, Seeing to Learn is a web-based project (macroinvertebrates.org) focused on training citizen scientists to identify aquatic macroinvertebrates for water quality monitoring projects. This open educational resource will be a powerful supplement to more-traditional identification keys used by volunteers. Many volunteer biomonitoring groups lack access to physical specimens and other high quality reference materials. Our tool features zoomable, high-resolution images for the 150 most commonly found taxa in the Eastern United States. Diagnostic characters for 50 selected taxa will have added multimedia annotations at the order, family, and genus level. These explorable images can be dynamically manipulated by the user to see and learn these important characters in context. Detailed descriptions of the diagnostic characters, life history, food preferences, ecological information, pollution tolerance values, and terminology supports will be provided to aid identification for each taxon.\r\r\nUsing design-based learning research and evaluation approaches, we will examine expert and learner practices through cognitive task analysis methods, and explore affordances of an innovative online field guide and collection of high-resolution aquatic macroinvertebrates images to facilitate science learning and engagement in taxonomic identification activities. This research study will help guide engagement and build capacity with scientists, citizen scientists, and informal science education (ISE) professionals to utilize new media technologies to facilitate public-science interactions and catalyze participatory kinds of science learning and research experiences with public audiences."

The overall research objective is to quantify how an advancing growing season and changes in the synchrony of vegetation-goose interactions alter the magnitudes and patterns of C and cycling in the Y- K Delta. Two specific questions will be addressed with an experiment: How does the timing of plant growth interact with goose arrival time to alter summer-long magnitudes of plant production, foliar chemistry, and availability; and, How does the timing of plant growth interact with goose arrival time to alter summer-long magnitudes of net ecosystem CO2 exchange, gross ecosystem photosynthesis, and ecosystem respiration?"

Photographic observations are used to monitor and measure changes in the local landscape in response to climate. Often, changes in the landscape are so subtle that we cannot see them without the help of modern technology. Picture Post provides a means for anyone to collect their own data, measure environmental change in their neighborhood, and contribute to a national database by sharing their photos on the Picture Post website. Every community can tell their story using Picture Post."

project_description: "Excess nitrogen associated with urbanization is a critical threat to the sustainability of coastal systems across the globe.  More than half the estuaries in the US show some level of impairment due to excess.  Concerns about nitrogen have intensified with the development of watershed implementation plans to achieve nutrient reductions required for compliance with new total maximum daily load regulations. This project is addressing the environmental, social and economic aspects of urban coastal sustainability and is producing insights that could transform assessments and management of coastal sustainability across the globe.  The research will resolve key uncertainties about nitrogen dynamics in a vitally important, increasingly common and dynamic land use type in the coastal zone, and directly address the human social and economic factors that underlie the capacity for improving these dynamics:  How efficient are stream restoration and installation of green infrastructure in reducing nitrogen delivery to the coast?  Are these effects easily overwhelmed by degradation of fundamental sanitary infrastructure?  Do coastal residents of different socio-economic status and distance to the coast really know and care about the ecological integrity of receiving waters?  Can their knowledge and interest be increased with citizen science efforts?  Answers to these questions will point the way forward for cities to address a key component of coastal sustainability on a sounder biophysical, social and economic footing."

project_description: "The Gravity Spy project enlists citizen scientists to help physicists and astronomers working on the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO).  With a system as incredibly sensitive as LIGO, sources of noise in the system can interfere with the search for gravitational-wave signals that come from merging black holes or other astrophysical systems.  Interestingly, though, one of the best ways to looks for noise, and differentiate between different sources of noise, is still the human eye.  Therefore, in this project, we ask for help from citizen scientists, who will have the opportunity to learn to characterize and classify potentially new sources of noise in the LIGO system; working in concert with machine-learning algorithms to amplify the work of the citizen scientists, this project helps scientists narrow their focus to gravitational wave sources and develop citizen science methods that can scale with upcoming data-intensive scientific endeavors."

project_description: "This project lays the foundations for the analysis and design of peer production systems consisting of socially interacting volunteers and machines that jointly perform distributed tasks. The envisioned implementation targets the unique scientific and societal domain offered by cyber-enabled citizen science environmental control in the highly polluted Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn. The proposed \"Brooklyn Atlantis\" citizen science system consists of an array of mobile instrumented buoys for water monitoring with wireless capabilities, controlled by volunteers using a web-based peer-production system.\r\r\nThrough the integration of dynamical systems theory, marine robotics, and technology-mediated social participation, the project will develop: 1) a model for complex systems comprising networks of humans and machines with a focus on technology-mediated social participation systems; 2) design guidelines for peer production systems to enhance participation in citizen science projects; and 3) a cyber-human infrastructure for real time monitoring and hazard detection of the natural environment combining mobile robotic sensor networks and human operated control systems.\r\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include: 1) establishing a technology-based avenue for enhancing local community citizenry and engagement; 2) developing citizen based environmental monitoring platforms that could provide life-saving advantages; 3) leveraging interactive robotics, environmental awareness, and citizen science to foster interest and engagement in STEM fields among the general public and K-12 students; 4) fostering multidisciplinary thinking among NYU-Poly students; 5) promoting the awareness of citizen science capabilities among researchers; and 6) integrating research components in outreach programs. This project has the potential of transforming the field of dynamical systems through the integration of collective human intelligence in the design and adaption of engineered architectures. Similarly, it may transform thinking on social peer production systems to incorporate real-time mobile interactive machines and task co-execution."

project_description: "In the era of data-intensive scientific discovery, Big Data scientists in all communities spend the majority of their time and effort collecting, integrating, curating, transforming, and assessing quality before actually performing discovery analysis. Some endeavors may even start from information not being available and accessible in digital form, and when it is available, it is often in non-structured form, not compatible with analytics tools that require structured and uniformly-formatted data. Two main methods to deal with the volume and variety of data as well as to accelerate the rate of digitization have been to apply crowdsourcing or machine-learning solutions. However, very little has been done to simultaneously take advantage of both types of solutions, and to make it easier for different efforts to share and reuse developed software elements. The vision of the Human- and Machine-Intelligent Network (HuMaIN) project is to accelerate scientific data digitization through fundamental advances in the integration and mutual cooperation between human and machine processing in order to handle practical hurdles and bottlenecks present in scientific data digitization. Even though HuMaIN concentrates on digitization tasks faced by the biodiversity community, the software elements being developed are generic in nature, and expected to be applicable to other scientific domains (e.g., exploring the surface of the moon for craters require the same type of crowdsourcing tool as finding words in text, and the same questions of whether machine-learning tools could provide similar results can be tested).\r\r\nThe HuMaIN project proposes to conduct research and develop the following software elements: (a) configurable Machine-Learning applications for scientific data digitization (e.g., Optical Character Recognition and Natural Language Processing), which will be made automatically available as RESTful services for increasing the ability of HuMaIN software elements to interoperate with other elements while decreasing the software development time via a new application specification language; (b) workflows leading to a cyber-human coordination system that will take advantage of feedback loops (e.g., based on consensus of crowdsourced data and its quality) for self-adaptation to changes and increased sustainability of the overall system, (c) new crowdsourcing micro-tasks with ability of being reusable for a variety of scenarios and containing user activity sensors for studying time-effective user interfaces, and (d) services to support automated creation and configuration of crowdsourcing workflows on demand to fit the needs of individual groups. A cloud-based system will be deployed to provide the necessary execution environment with traceability of service executions involved in cyber-human workflows, and cost-effectiveness analysis of all the software elements developed in this project will provide assessment and evaluation of long standing what-if scenarios pertaining human- and machine-intelligent tasks. Crowdsourcing activities will attract a wide range of users with tasks that require low expertise, and at the same time it will expose volunteers to applied science and engineering, potentially attracting interest of K-12 teachers and students."

project_description: "Since the Spring of 2011, we have deployed an Android application called WiEye, which is currently in use by over 10k ongoing users and has collected over 250 million measurements. There are multiple stages of the project that will be ongoing that will leverage this WiEye database for crowdsourcing research:\r\n1. Step 1: We must first finalize our understanding of how a mobile phone approach the fidelity of more advanced, costly instrumentation specifically designed to measure wireless behavior in terms of course metrics such as signal strength and spectral activity.\r\n2. Step 2: From there, channel modeling to the degree that primary (e.g., line-of-sight) paths or secondary (e.g., multiple non-direct) paths are understood for diverse types of environments and/or geographical factors must then be studied.\r\nFor example, we will characterize a mountainous region (versus the flat DFW area) as I will teach a course at SMU in Taos this summer called Mobile Phone Embedded Design (EE 5378/7378), where spectral activity, wireless propagation, and structural health of unique infrastructure will be measured in the Taos region.\r\n3. Step 3: More generally, we then will investigate what role does geographical information (such as LIDAR data) has on the performance of wireless networks by isolating each effect (e.g., tree canopy height and width, land use, amount of free space, and building height and area). The detailed understanding obtained here will help tremendously for the spatial dimensions that are emerging as problematic for such applications as dynamic spectrum access.\r\n4. Step 4: Finally, we will focus on our works impact on the standardization efforts (e.g., License Assisted Access), dynamic spectrum access, and broader-reaching applications for the crowdsourced based understanding of wireless environments including continue to pursue commercialization that is a result of NSF I-Corps as well as the multi- disciplinary objectives discussed above."

project_description: "The naming and classifying of living organisms is a fundamental principal upon which biology is founded. Indeed, almost every facet of our lives - from the food we eat to the medicine we take, the houses we live in to the natural scenery we admire - has a connection to the biodiversity present on Earth. All species must be named and cataloged in order for humans to understand the world around us. The scientific field of taxonomy, responsible for identifying and describing species, has incurred a reduction in its specialist workforce in recent decades; this is unfortunate because the need for taxonomy has never been greater as human activities result in unprecedented decline in the diversity of life. This project will help to reduce the burden placed on current and future taxonomists to identify and catalog biodiversity by introducing a set of open-source, web-based tools for identifying species from images and for measuring imaged specimens for comparative studies. These software tools will be made freely available through the publicly-funded CyVerse web platform. In addition, a system for identifying dragonflies and damselflies called ODOMATIC will be implemented on an existing web presence, OdonataCentral, allowing researchers and enthusiasts to accurately identify these insects from images of their wings. A series of free workshops will be offered in diverse urban communities in New Jersey and Alabama to increase the diversity of OdonataCentral?s user base, encourage participation in the STEM fields, and generally increase appreciation and understanding of the natural world. A series of Google Hangout events will encourage international user-ship for ODOMATIC from World Dragonfly Association members in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. In addition, undergraduate students from Rutgers University-Newark will be recruited to help in designing and training ODOMATIC, giving them valuable experience in research, programming and taxonomy.\r\r\nThis work will help to reduce the taxonomic impediment - an urgent need for more taxonomic products, like species descriptions and specimen identifications, from fewer taxonomist workers - by addressing the time-consuming, but necessary, task that is species identification. Objectives of this project include release of a newly-developed system for automatically identifying Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) from images of their wings, which uses computer vision and machine learning to characterize and classify species. An interface will be deployed making species identification using this system accessible through the OdonataCentral website (odonatacentral.org). In addition, stand-alone tools will be developed for automatically describing and placing geometric morphometric landmarks on specimens in biological imagery for use in morphology-based comparative studies. The successful completion of these objectives will benefit the odonatological community by providing dragonfly and damselfly identification. More broadly, the tools created here will allow biologists studying other groups of organisms to rapidly extract morphological data from images of their specimens."

project_description: "This Frontier award supports the SONYC project, a smart cities initiative focused on developing a cyber-physical system (CPS) for the monitoring, analysis and mitigation of urban noise pollution. Noise pollution is one of the topmost quality of life issues for urban residents in the U.S. with proven effects on health, education, the economy, and the environment. Yet, most cities lack the resources for continuously monitoring noise and understanding the contribution of individual sources, the tools to analyze patterns of noise pollution at city-scale, and the means to empower city agencies to take effective, data-driven action for noise mitigation. The SONYC project advances novel technological and socio-technical solutions that help address these needs.\r\r\nSONYC includes a distributed network of both sensors and people for large-scale noise monitoring. The sensors use low-cost, low-power technology, and cutting-edge machine listening techniques, to produce calibrated acoustic measurements and recognizing individual sound sources in real time. Citizen science methods are used to help urban residents connect to city agencies and each other, understand their noise footprint, and facilitate reporting and self-regulation. Crucially, SONYC utilizes big data solutions to analyze, retrieve and visualize information from sensors and citizens, creating a comprehensive acoustic model of the city that can be used to identify significant patterns of noise pollution. This data can in turn be used to drive the strategic application of noise code enforcement by city agencies, in a way that optimally reduces noise pollution. The entire system, integrating cyber, physical and social infrastructure, forms a closed loop of continuous sensing, analysis and actuation on the environment. \r\r\nSONYC is an interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers at New York University and Ohio State University. It provides multiple educational opportunities to students at all levels, including an outreach initiative for K-12 STEM education. The project uses New York City as its focal point, involving partnerships with the city's Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the business improvement district of Lower Manhattan, and ARUP, one of the world's leaders in environmental acoustics. SONYC is an innovative and high-impact application of cyber-physical systems to the realm of smart cities, and potentially a catalyst for new CPS research at the intersection of engineering, data science and the social sciences. It provides a blueprint for the mitigation of noise pollution that can be applied to cities in the US and abroad, potentially affecting the quality of life of millions of people."

project_description: "Introduction\r\r\nThis project lays the foundations for a causal analysis of lay/expert collaborative research or citizen science. While the potential of such collaborations to advance knowledge and societal well-being are well known, little is known about what makes them succeed or fail. The PIs propose to bridge this gap by adopting a new approach that goes beyond traditional observational studies. The PIs propose to use mixed methods and an innovative parallel-study design. They will demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by examining the social conditions and processes that produce or forestall transformative, community-driven science in response to the current Gulf oil disaster. In addition, they plan to produce interdisciplinary and socially robust environmental knowledge about the impacts of the disaster by combining the expertise of environmental scientists, social scientists, and Vietnamese-Americans living and working in south Louisiana who bring their deep experiential knowledge of the region?s impacted ecosystems to the scientific work. \r\r\nIntellectual Merits\r\r\nThe proposed study is interdisciplinary. It is designed to advance basic social studies of science while simultaneously contributing to the production of socially robust environmental science. It does so in the form of two parallel analyses. The first is a community-driven toxicological study of wetlands contamination; the second is a sociological analysis of the initiation, development, and execution of that collaborative process. Both studies address substantively important problems. The community-driven study will investigate the exposure and impacts of petroleum hydrocarbons on finfish species that are culturally and economically important to Vietnamese-Americans whose livelihoods rely on commercial and subsistence fishing. Working together, residents and scientists will identify and prioritize target species and biological endpoints. The findings of the study will provide sound data that form the basis for hypothesis-driven future research on the long-term ecological impacts of the disaster. The sociological study will investigate the lay/expert collaboration for insight into the causal processes that generate successful citizen science. \r\r\nPotential Broader Impacts \r\r\nThe interdisciplinary knowledge produced by this study will aid in scientific efforts to investigate the social and environmental impacts of the oil disaster by capturing time-sensitive social and ecological data that can be used by other natural and social scientists. The community-driven nature of the project and contributions to knowledge production by an underrepresented social group helps ensure that the scientific knowledge will be socially meaningful to Gulf Coast residents and local governments as well state and federal agencies working to mitigate disaster impacts. The project also holds significant educational opportunities. These include opportunities for interdisciplinary exchanges between social and natural scientists, and research training opportunities for undergraduate students and adult non-scientists. The project will also enhance institutional relationships between Tulane and Washington State Universities that bridge regional and public/private divides in the academy. Finally, the proposed study has strong potential to seed an effective and sustainable community-academic network for addressing ecological and environmental health issues in south Louisiana and elsewhere."

Our trapping activity is easy, fun, effective, and utilizes items found in the everyday household (2L bottle, hand sanitizer, etc.).\r\r\nThis activity can be completed by anyone, anywhere. It is especially useful as a hands-on activity to complement in-school lessons focused on topics like native/invasive species, forest health, environmental stewardship, etc. and has been used in courses spanning multiple disciplines (e.g., environmental science, entomology, ecology, etc.).\r\r\nOur website (www.backyardbarkbeetles.org) is easily accessible and contains all the information needed to participate (informational handouts, instructions, etc.). Also, teachers: a narrated lesson on bark & ambrosia beetles is available that can be modified for in-class use.\r\r\nOnce we receive your beetles, they will be identified and promptly added to the interactive map, which can be found at bottom of the project's homepage (www.backyardbarkbeetles.org). On this map, you can view pictures and read information about the beetles you (and fellow citizen scientists!) have collected. Almost instant feedback!\r\r\nWith this program, we can learn where populations have become established and track newly invasive species, all while engaging the public (i.e., citizen scientists) in real-world scientific research. Help us understand what kinds of bark beetles are in YOUR backyard!\r\r\nAdditional information & participant feedback can be found on our Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/backyardbarkbeetles/) and Twitter (https://twitter.com/BackyardBeetles?lang=en) pages.\r\r\nQuestions? Send them to lab@backyardbarkbeetles.org."

project_description: "This project will develop theory, algorithms, and example systems for motivating large numbers of autonomous individuals to solve problems that require coordination in the physical world. In these \"physical crowdsourcing\" systems, people make small contributions toward a larger collective problem, such as tracking animal species or air quality for citizen science projects or providing rides or package delivery in commercial applications. In these systems, opportunistically relying on people to do convenient parts of the problem causes incomplete solutions, while directing people to do inconvenient tasks requires high incentives. By modeling the timing and location of tasks, along with knowledge of people's routines, the project will develop algorithms that make use of ideas from decision theory to best decide when, where and to whom to suggest tasks, in a way that balances individual convenience with system needs. Doing this should increase people's willingness to participate, reduce the need to incentivize participation, and create more complete, timely, and accurate solutions to the collective problem. The investigators will develop several prototype systems that address practical problems such as package delivery and lost and found searches to demonstrate the effectiveness of their ideas; they will also release a toolkit that allows other people to use their work when designing their own physical crowdsourcing systems for solving both scientific and practical problems of interest to society. \r\r\nThe work will be carried out in three main phases. The first phase will develop \"incentive chaining\", a strategy to encourage opportunistic contributors to become more directable. Using an existing prototype for surveying tree species, the team will model people's opportunistic contributions and routines, then suggest relatively easy \"nearby\" tasks where others have contributed but where further work is needed, building people's interest and capacity to contribute. Once the nearby collaborative tasks are done, the system will direct these experienced and motivated contributors toward new areas and tasks, which will in turn become the \"nearby\" contributions that attract the next round of contributors. The second phase will develop decision-theoretic hit-or-wait algorithms to decide if and when to notify contributors about tasks, using a community-based lost and found application. Building on the modeling of behavioral routines, these algorithms will use sequential decision processes to estimate the maximize total value of tasks that contributors will complete, given individuals' history and current state, the system-determined value of nearby tasks, and the system's estimate of how likely the contributor would be to respond to a notification. The third phase will develop notification policies that satisfy the system's quality of service needs while minimizing disruption to contributors. To do this, the investigators will develop a supply management framework that considers the pool of available helpers, the current task demand and values, and a range of policies for making directed requests and evaluate it in the context of a peer-to-peer package delivery system."

This project aims to improve not only calibration methods for these sensors, but also method of detecting de-calibration and ways to leverage separate data sets (e.g., local traffic) through machine learning. Overall this will result in a more robust and useful sensing system that will support air quality and public health investigations. Additionally, features like an associated app and database will make the platform more user friendly. The MetaSense monitors have been deployed in Los Angeles as part of a larger campaign to examine community questions around urban oil and gas development and we hope to utilize them for more community-based research applications in the future."

The research will enable a new generation of community-based cyber-physical systems, in which the community helps to detect, communicate and respond to rapidly evolving events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, floods and epidemics. The research has a strong pragmatic focus on developing sensors and software which enable the collection of situational information and the dissemination of alerts. Methods for performing sensing analysis and data fusion in the Cloud are being incorporated so as to address tradeoffs among rates of false positive alarms, false negative alarms, and time to detection. Techniques are also being developed for reliable and timely alerting of communities and individuals; these techniques exploit geographical and societal scale correlations to improve the speed and resilience of the dissemination process."

project_description: "The All Taxa Biodiversity Inventory (ATBI)/BioBlitz SWAT Teams are graduate students who survey gaps in biodiversity understanding on vital public and private lands, design field research that narrows those gaps and create media about their work that fosters public understanding and inspires better care of our planet. Research on biodiversity and the relationship between organisms is imperative to develop management practices for the conservation of protected areas. The E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation, along with the National Park Service, Discover Life in America and Turner Endangered Species Fund, formed our team of four Duke University students as the first of many groups of students to travel to protected areas and develop approaches to conduct biodiversity research that can inform its conservation. Our team assessed the current status of biodiversity research at Rocky Mountain National Park to determine major gaps in the understanding of biodiversity. We used various data sources to find species lists from research conducted in the Park to ensure that the National Park Species Database was updated with the most recent information. Our team added 667 species to the database through this process. One of the identified gaps was a lack of research on spiders in the park. We piloted a field study on spider biodiversity to identify species existing in the park and to understand their ecological roles. Our resulting field study added 102 new spider species to the park database. We also conducted a mini-Bioblitz with adults and children in order to foster an interest in citizen science activities. Finally, we created a video to create awareness about our topic, foster curiosity, and spark interest in the area of science and biodiversity."

"The River Mile is a participant driven approach to learning about, researching and exploring the watershed health of the Columbia River. Participants share best practices, lessons learned, examples, links to resources and real world scientific data. Students and teachers engage in science education outdoors and explore scientific practices through real-world resource projects. By spending time in the field investigating and researching their section of the watershed, groups become intimately familiar with their outdoor classroom. The Pacific Northwest has only 3 native species of crayfish and at least 6 non-native species. It appears that there is only one native species in Washington. Data is lacking on crayfish, so you and your students can contribute critical data by collecting and sharing data about the crayfish in your area. Additional information about this study and its protocols is available on TRM’s webpage."

California Condors are one of the world’s most endangered bird species with a population of only 22 condors in the early 1980s. Despite successful captive breeding and release efforts in recent years, the condor population remain heavily managed because they are frequently poisoned by lead from bullet fragments ingested in scavenged carcasses. Condor release sites, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service and Ventana Wildlife Society, offer uncontaminated carcasses to birds as a way to lure them back for medical care and regular management activities. These feeding stations are equipped with automatically triggered cameras that have captured photographs of condors.The Condor Watch project is using citizen science to help us tag these photos so that they be analyzed."

project_description: "Sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is a key cultural and ecological resource in northeastern North America. Maple syrup production has been expanding across the region, despite predictions that sugar maple may be particularly sensitive to climate change. Given these trends, projections of the direct impacts of climate change on maple syrup production are needed to guide regional stakeholders to adapt to future climate variability. This study examines the effects of climate variation on sugar maple quality. Our primary goal is to provide quantitative data on how sugar maple syrup quality is vulnerable to changing climate conditions."

project_description: "The result of a National Park Service-George Mason University Climate Change Communication Internship, the wayside exhibit inRock Creek Park link plants, forest structure, and bird populations (wood thrush) with climate.\r\r\"To tell Rock Creek’s climate story, the interns’ work focused on the wood\r\nthrush, the official bird of Washington, D.C. Interns researched why Rock Creek is an ideal habitat for the wood thrush by exploring the bird’s migratory patterns, preferred food sources, and habitat choice. ... The design of the wayside creates a connection between visitors and the park by giving a view of the landscape as it would be seen by the wood thrush. One aspect of this story is the parallel between the wood thrush’s annual migration to Nicaragua and the growing community of Latin American immigrants near Rock Creek National Park. ...Other components include citizen science opportunities at the park and links to other resources, such as the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center.\" http://esp.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ESP_Newsletter_Fall_2013.pdf"

In the midst of underfunded state volunteer monitoring programs, the Secchi Dip-In has served as a place for volunteers to continue submitting their data. In 2015, Dr. Robert Carlson transferred the operation of the Secchi Dip-In to the North American Lake Management Society and over the past 20 years, the database accumulated more than 41,000 records on more than 7,000 individual waterbodies."

project_description: "Summer on the Marsh followed from our successful Summer Science project by establishing a regional network of eight summer camp programs grounded in field experiences for environmental education in the marsh ecosystem. The two-year program included citizen science monitoring by campers ages 9-12, support and training for informal science center staff and partner scientists, and dissemination to peers at regional and national forums. Collaboration throughout the project enabled partner organizations to share activities and knowledge in both informal education and the significance of marsh ecosystems. The project served 45 staff (educators and scientists) and 547 youth over two years across New England. The project funding ended in December 2015, but we have made our data, protocol and data sheets available on CitSci.org. We know some of our original camps will continue to collect data, and hope we can inspire others to adopt it as well. \r\nThe project was successful in supporting environmental stewardship in all involved. Educators and scientists benefited from working together closely. We found that a strong connection between the scientist and educators increased enthusiasm which was then expressed at camp. Our two day training’s at the beginning of each year helped with this connection. The campers came in describing salt marshes as smelly, muddy places and left the program describing marshes as barriers, food sources, and filters. The campers changed their view from self-focused to an ecosystem focus. This awareness of marsh functions will likely lead to increased environmental stewardship. In fact, parent surveys in the Fall following camp reported that the majority of campers had taken actions to protect the environment."

He made a serious study of birds as a child, collecting bird skins and nests, and keeping lists of the species that he observed. Theodore Roosevelt chose to build his home in Oyster Bay partly for the opportunity to observe the diverse local wildlife and to experience healthful outdoor exercise.\nThis Centennial Birdblitz will give people the opportunity to enjoy the hearty outdoor life that Theodore Roosevelt enjoyed while compiling a list of the bird species present at Sagamore Hill today.  It has been over ten years since the last bird survey and seeing what change has occurred in the bird populations will be interesting and valuable, especially in the context of climate change."

One reason is the frequent use of research techniques that are not accessible to Deaf people. In response to these issues, we will lead Deaf ACCESS: Adapting Consent through Community Engagement and State-of-the-art Simulation. Collaborating with Deaf community members as part of our research team, we will adapt informed consent procedures to make them more Deaf-friendly, and then use medical simulation to train research assistants how to recruit and enroll Deaf research participants. Our long-term goal is to increase the number of Deaf people who participate in biomedical research studies, and encourage more Deaf people to become actively engaged in the research world."

project_description: "GLOBE, the Global Learning and Observations to benefit the Environment Program, is a worldwide program that brings together students, teachers, scientists and citizens to promote science and learning about the environment.  Through a hands-on approach to inquiry, participants are encouraged to engage in local investigations that cover five core fields: atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, soil (pedosphere), and Earth as a system. Observations made locally are submitted to the GLOBE data and information system, and can be accessed freely online. These measurements are combined with readings at automated stations to create a worldwide resource for conducting scientific inquiry; some measurements serve as ground truth for NASA satellite data products (e.g., clouds, soil moisture).  The GLOBE data and information system contains over 145 million measurements from more than 10 million students in 119 countries around the world since its operation begun in 1995. Beginning in 2016, GLOBE expanded its participation outside of the formal school setting to include individual citizens of all ages through the GLOBE Observer mobile app."

project_description: "National Jewish Health and RTI International are teaming up with the City of Denver, Groundwork Denver, and Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to learn how communities can use personal air quality monitors to understand air pollution and take action to protect their health. Taking place in Denver’s Globeville and Elyria/Swansea neighborhoods, this study aims to facilitate citizen’s understanding of their air quality exposure, both outside and in their home environment. As part of this study, citizen scientists will engage with data collection and analytics through written reports and smart phone applications, and will receive exposure coaching, in an effort to cultivate data understanding, encourage actions for exposure reduction, and guide informational preferences for the future."

project_description: "The S'COOL Project involves people (ages 5-99) in real science, taking and reporting ground truth observations of clouds to assist in the validation of NASA's Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments.   CERES  is an important tool for scientists who study how atmospheric moisture affects our weather and climate. The observations made by S'COOL help to provide another piece of the puzzle. The project, which began in 1997, is coordinated with satellites that carry CERES instruments as well as geostationary weather satellites. S'COOL was developed from the beginning in coordination with teachers who sought a safe, simple and cheap way to unite students with NASA.  In 2008 technology advances enabled S'COOL to accept observations from citizen scientists anywhere in the world.  Since 2016, S'COOL is integrated with GLOBE cloud observations observations, but still accepts\nobservations directly from non-GLOBE countries. GLOBE countries submit their cloud\nobservations through NASA GLOBE Clouds - https://www.globe.gov/web/s-cool."

project_description: "SMART seeks to empower females and minorities to use science and engineering to research water quality in their local watershed. Students engage in numerous science and technology fields: engineering design, data acquisition, analysis and visualization, chemistry, environmental science, biology, and information technology. Students also connect with a diversity of professionals in water and engineering in government, private firms and non-profits. Dedicated mentors support SMART students as they research water issues within their communities. SMART began in the State of Maine. Now, through an NSF INCLUDES grant, SMART has expanded to eight states (New York, North Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, Idaho, and California), where partners are designing stormwater-themed projects that address their location and demographic specific needs."
