## Agency Citizen Science and Crowdsourcing Coordinators
The Agency Citizen Science and Crowdsourcing Coordinators are a group of federal employees designated by their agency leaders to be the point people for advancing crowdsourcing and citizen science.  The need for these Coordinators was articulated in a [September 2015 memo](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/09/30/accelerating-use-citizen-science-and-crowdsourcing-address-societal-and-scientific) from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to the heads of federal departments and agencies.
#### What the Agency Coordinators Do
Today, these coordinators are:
- Working with GSA to maintain and improve the citizen science and crowdsourcing catalog for all such projects across the U.S. government;
- Collaborating to increase interagency coordination and to participate in future policy-development discussions on this subject; and

- Teaming to encourage public awareness of and participation in citizen science and crowdsourcing efforts.
As coordinators, these individuals advocate for citizen science and crowdsourcing where possible, and provide a support network and mentoring for each other and their respective agencies for future projects.
