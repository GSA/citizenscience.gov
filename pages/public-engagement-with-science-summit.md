## Event Background and Purpose:
This Summit is inspired by the letter sent in August 2023 by PCAST to President Biden on [Advancing Public Engagement with the Sciences](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PCAST_Science-Engagement-Letter_August2023.pdf). In the letter, PCAST issued a call to action to advance public engagement with science. </span>

Public engagement and inclusive dialogue are essential to science and technology that benefits the health, environment, national security, and well-being of all Americans. Federal agencies play a critical role in creating avenues for robust science and technology communication and public engagement.</span>
